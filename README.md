# NotSoBored Games

</div>


<div align="left">

## Our Webpage

NotSoBored games is a concept designed to help tackle social isolation and loneliness in the elderly population by the means  an easy to use, multiplayer online board game experience. The overarching aim of this project is to use this online board game experience to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older people. To realise this aim, we create an online multiplayer gaming/video communication application through a single page app (SPA). This serves to connect older adults, reduce levels of loneliness and improve health and wellbeing. Given the huge societal change due to the current Covid-19 pandemic and national lockdown, this seems an important intervention to help tackle these public health concerns.

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to explore whether an single page app (SPA) can be used as a fun tool for reconnecting the elderly to tackle the growing issue of loneliness and isolation in the elderly population.

In our project report we explain and analyse our SPA, from ideation to implementation. We also cover background literature, do a state-of-the-art surveyidentify promising avenues for future work.

You can find the table of contents below which links you to each of the subsections of our report.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
