## Aims and Objectives

The overarching aim of this project is to use an online board game experience to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older people. To realise this aim, we create an engaging, easy-to-use online multiplayer gaming application with video communication functionality delivered through a single page app (SPA).

Given the huge societal impact of the COVID-19 crisis with restrictions on people's lives and enforced "social distancing" measures, there has been a significant rise in levels of loneliness and social isolation in the general population, particularly in older adults [[**1**]](#references).  NotSoBored games is designed to help combat these public health concerns. Our proposed method differs from and contributes to existing methods by combing a simple, visually appealing user interface with video communication functionality. This deliver an engaging experience unlike existing online games which lack video communication and ease of use. We offer a novel alternative.

The main objective of this project is to explore whether we can improve upon existing online games for the elderly by delivering an SPA that can be used as a tool that is fun, engaging and easy to use. We investigate the hypothesis that the application can improve the quality of life of our stakeholders by conducting user testing. Based on our results, we believe our application can be used to help tackle the growing issue of loneliness and isolation in this group.

In our project report we explain and analyse our SPA, from ideation to implementation, we also give an overview of background literature, do a state-of-the-art survey and identify promising avenues for future work. You can find the table of contents below which links you to each of the subsections of our report.
