# NotSoBored Games
</div>


<div align="left">

## Our Webpage

NotSoBored games is a concept designed to help tackle social isolation and loneliness in the elderly population through an easy-to-use, multiplayer online board game experience. With four fun board games to choose from, you will be spoilt for choice as you play with friends and family to compete for the top spot on the leaderboard.

If you're tired of lockdown and want to connect with loved ones then this engaging multiplayer experience is just for you.

## Project Objectives

The overarching aim of this project is to use this online board game experience to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older people. To realise this aim, we create an online multiplayer gaming/video communication application through a single page app (SPA).

This web app serves to connect older adults in a fun and engaging environment with the goal of reducing levels of loneliness and improving health and wellbeing. Given the huge societal change since the Covid-19 pandemic, we feel that this is an important and useful tool to help combat these public health concerns.

The main objective of this project is to explore whether a single page app (SPA) can be used as a  tool to improve the quality of life of older people and help tackle the growing issue of loneliness and isolation in this group.

In our project report we explain and analyse our SPA, from ideation to implementation, as well as research background literature, a state-of-the-art survey and identify promising avenues for future work. You can find the table of contents below which links you to each of the subsections of our report.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
