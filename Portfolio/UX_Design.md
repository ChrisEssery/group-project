## UX Design

With regards to the background literature we decided to...

### Design Process and ideation

The following are photos of the ideas matrix we used to generate ideas for the application. Different types of games are in the rows and different types of real-world issues are in the columns.

As you can see, the rows are populated with different types of games. These include 'unforgiving games' 'card games' 'guessing games' and 'educational games'. Along the columns there are different real-world issues such as 'political issues' 'mental health issues' and 'learning english'.

## Identification of users and stakeholders

When identifying the users and stakeholders we took the decision to...

## UX approach - design methods

When considering the UX approach we felt it was important to choose something that was relevant and of genuine importance. As such, we honed in on majar issues facing society. After drafting two project proposals we decided that NotSoBored Games was the best project given the constraints of time, skills and resources we had to design and implement the application.
