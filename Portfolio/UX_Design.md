# UX Design

In this section, we discuss the User Experience (UX) design of our app. We start by outlining the design process and ideation and evolution of user interface (UI) design. We then identify our stakeholders and provide details regarding their 'stories'. Following this, we discuss our UX approach and design and discuss the importance of the user group.

## UX Design

With regard to the UX design, we felt it was very important early on to consider how the design of our product would impact our stakeholders. We began this process in the project ideation phase. For a discussion on our design process and ideation, see [Design process and ideation](#design-process-and-ideation).

We also realised that this design process would change and develop over time. To capture this evolution of our design, we provide a detailed overview of the evolution of our UI design. For a discussion of this, see [Evolution of UI Design](#evolution-of-ui-design). As previously mentioned, from an early stage we were very aware of how important our stakeholders were in shaping the UI design. For details about our users and stakeholders, see [Identification of users and stakeholders](#identification-of-users-and-stakeholders). Finally, we talk about our approach to UX, and in particular, focus on the design methods we made use of to ensure that our product met their personal requirements. For a discussion of this, see [UX approach - design methods](#ux-approach--design-methods).

### Design Process and ideation


First, let's discuss our design process and ideation. This phase of the project was not only fun and exciting but it gave rise to a collaborative ideation which lay the foundations for our product. This process occurred over a relatively short timeframe, and involved changes, alterations and refinements along the way.

Below is a mind map created for our project ideation phase. This mind map shows the different types of games we were considering when trying to determine what board game to build. The types of games were decided by our team during a group meeting on Microsoft Teams. Each team member contributed their own ideas, and we compiled a list of games that we knew of and were interested in.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/mind_map.png)

</div>

As you can see, the list of games we came up with encompassed a wide range of possible games, each of which has a large possibility of specific games within each type of game. We felt that this range encompassed enough variation for us to be creative and come up with interesting suggestions during the ideation phase.

Below is another mind map which contains different world issues and problems. As with the above mind map, as a team we came up with a list of real world problems during one of our first meetings concerning the game ideation. The idea here was to use a particular type of game to tackle one of these real world problems. So, for instance, green/environmental issues could be addressed through an educational card game or a board game.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/mind_map2.png)

</div>

The images below show the ideas matrix we used to generate ideas for the application. As you can see, types of games are in the rows and types of real-world issues are in the columns. This creates a matrix where the remaining cells within the matrix should be populated with a particular game to solve a particular world problem.

[![ideas1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/TwvNhtdg/ideas1.png)](https://postimg.cc/WDSwH6J1)

As you can see, the rows are populated with different types of games. These include 'unforgiving games' 'card games' 'guessing games' and 'educational games'. Along the columns there are different real-world issues such as 'political issues' 'mental health issues' and 'learning english'.

[![ideas.png](https://i.postimg.cc/GtcMx9sp/ideas.png)](https://postimg.cc/MMFbW65k)

After some deliberation our team decided that we would develop a product designed to help older adults socialise through the medium of online games. This, we felt, was a very relevant issue in society - one which we all had experience of with grandparents - and it was an issue which could be addressed through serious play. As mentioned the [Background](#https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md) section of the report, this concept was essential for shaping our understanding of the product, what it would look like and how it would work.

We realised that the serious problem of the rules needed to be fun and integrated right from the beginning of the application. So, it became clear, after consultation with our end-users that we ought to include a simple, clear outline of the rules in the start page.

Does our app have a clear goal? Is this apparent up front to the user? or uncovered through use? or never discovered? Raising awareness? Provoking behaviour change and facilitating learning and promoting wellbeing through socialising. Motivations with respect to the gameplay. The users have extrinsic motivations in the form of leaderboards, winning and social contact and then that turns into intrinsic motivation of enjoyment, purpose, growth and curiosity. Intrinsic and extrinsic.

Gamification commonly occurs when extrinsic motivators are applied without providing support for the development of intrinsic motivators. Also occurs when the extrinsic motivators are not valuable enough. Scores and leaderboard, does your game display progress over time? Does there need to be a score? It supports extrinsic factors and they can be highly motivating and terrible for those who are doing worse. We decided to include a collaborative enterprise in the memory game so as to include a cooperation component to the gameplay. The concept of serious play should be included in introduction, background, evaluation

Overall, this design and ideation phase was an excellent way to bounce around ideas and hone in on a limited range of games our SPA could deploy. But it required refinement. In particular, we needed to improve and enhance the UI design. So, we moved on to produce a paper prototype, prototype video, UI wireframe and an updated UI wireframe. It is to this we now turn.


### Evolution of UI Design

**Version 1: paper prototype**

At this stage, we used the shared powerpoint in Teams to brainstorm and design each web page separately with consideration of the content and functionality of each page.

**Version 2: short paper prototype video**

At this stage, we integrated all the web pages together and focused on adding navigation between the pages. We filmed a short video demo to make sure the navigation flow goes well.

  <br/>
  <b >Paper Prototype Demo</b>
  <br/><br/>
</p>

**Version 3: UI wireframe in Figma**

At this stage, we converted the paper prototype of our website to a wireframe to simulate all the features (including the structure of menu, button control, requests and responses) we have planned with the use of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) (a digital design and prototyping tool). See our initial wireframe version [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/0CgBZ0XKPHl8fCcgvPSsWr/NotSoBoredGames-Copy?node-id=6%3A137&scaling=scale-down&page-id=6%3A121).


**Version 4: Updated UI wireframe in Figma**

We distributed the digital UI prototype to the potential users and created a test to gather user feedback with a focus on the feasibility of the website, the functionality and ease of use. We distributed our digital UI prototype to the potential users with an online questionnaire to gather feedback and update our wireframes.

Here are some sample questions from the prototype test:
![image](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/images/test1.png)
![image](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/images/test2.png)
![image](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/images/test3.png)
See our full test report [here](https://my.helio.app/report/01F1WDKPM82XVYYJVE0HS5Q93T).
<br/><br/>
Based on the report, we focused on the following key issues to update:
- We updated the profile page of the user and added more information about the user's gaming experience to enhance the user experience. This includes the number of matches recently played, the win rate of the user, the people recently played with etc.

- We added a "how to play" button under the title of each games and the player can click on the button to learn the rules and operations before starting the game.

- After the game menu page, we planned to add a new option for the user to choose who they want to play with. If the user chooses to play with friends, we will provide the online friends from their friendlist so that they can select and send invitation to the friend.

- We added a button to view the leaderboard of each game.

- We used combination of text and icon to present information/button.

Here is the [updated wireframe](https://www.figma.com/proto/fEaURWLCXr8yoBFjMjvQzi/NotSoBoredGames?node-id=6%3A137&scaling=scale-down&page-id=6%3A121) for our website:
<br/><br/>
<p align="center">

  <br/>
  <b align="center">UI Wireframe</b>
  <br/><br/>
</p>
The UI wireframe above provides a low-fidelity skeleton of the UI. Without getting bogged down in the visual design of the app, his serves to show the main features, layout, content, and functionality of the UI. It is essential in UI design as it determines what the user will eventually interact with when they eventually use the software, and it helps those working on the front-end of the product to better understand how they should design and build the main features and functions of the UI. This then can be presented in the form of a UI demo, as shown below:
<br/><br/>
<p align="center">
  <img width="700" height="400" src="https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/images/Wireframe.gif" alt="">
  <br/>
  <b align="center">UI Demo</b>
  <br/><br/>
</p>

This demo shows the way the user will navigate through our application, and how they will play the games with other players. As you can see, in each of these stages the UI design of our product evolved and developed. This development took us from a very crude paper prototype to a clear, intuitive, well thought out UI wireframe, the functionality of which is demonstrated in the above demo. It also gave us a visual template for the front end of our product.


## Identification of users and stakeholders

When identifying the users and stakeholders, we took the decision to use two end-users and two additional stakeholders to advise us during the development lifecycle.

```
  1. End-user: member of target group
  2. End-user: member of target group
  3. Product manager: specialist external advisor
  4. Sponsor: external sponsor with understanding of end-users

```

The end-users are two members of our target group, both with interests in online gaming as a platform for connecting with others. The two additional stakeholders are a product manager who offers advice on the design of the product, and a care home manager acting as a sponsor. It is important to note that these end-users and stakeholders are all 'proto-personas', namely they are fictional characters whose identities have been created to guarantee our approach aligns with the agile method. It is also important to note that the views of these fictional characters represent real feedback collected from real users during user testing.

These proto-personas are based on assumptions about the relevant stakeholders, and are designed to simulate the approach taken in a real-life agile project, during which there is a continuous dialogue between the software development team and their clients, owing to the client-led approach at the heart of the agile framework.

There was plenty of scope to include more stakeholders to this list of four, however due to time-constraints we decided that four stakeholders would suffice to inform us during the each sprint.

## Stakeholders

In what follows, we will outline our stakeholder stories. These stories will list important and relevant information about our stakeholders, particularly with regard to their knowledge and experience of the product we will be developing. These stakeholders will then form a major part of our sprints, the details of which can be found in [Documentation of sprints](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Sprints_Project_Management.md#documentation-of-sprints).

## End-user

Turning to our stakeholders, we have the first of our end-users. This end-user is called is Bob Smith. Below we have broken down his 'wants' and 'challenges', as well as his motivations, experience, expectations, and special requirements in relation to our product.

___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/user_bob_profile.jpg)

</div>

### Motivations

Bob enjoys playing board games, but he has no experience with digital games. His motivations are as follows:

   * He wants a challenge, but he wants to do this with friends or family.
   * He also doesn't want to get lost in the complexity of a 'busy' interface.
   * He wants to play games to stimulate his brain and learn more.

He thinks that online games aren't just for teenagers, they're for people of all ages, and that if the process of playing online games was made more accessible and easy-to-understand then there would be a greater uptake in online games among older adults.

### Expectations

Bob's expectations are as follows:

   * He expects the application will be easy to use.
   * He wants the interface to bright, bold and easy to see.
   * He wants to be challenged by the games.
   * He wants to compete against other players.

### Special Requirements

Bob'd special requirements are:

   * Bob's vision has been fading for a few years so he would really like to have a bright, lively interface to engage with.
   * Bob's memory occasionally fails him, so he would like there to be short instructions on how to play the games.

Tailoring the design of the product to meet these needs would, therefore, be beneficial to sally's experience.

## End-user

The second of our end-users is Sally Gardner. Her personal requirements are included below.

___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/user_sally_profile.jpg)

</div>

### Motivations

Sally knows nothing about digital games. She used to play board games when she was younger, but she doesn't play anyone since she doesn't socialise very much. After her husband passed away a few years ago, she began to withdraw from social life. Her family visit her when they can, but they would like to see her more often. Her motivations are:

   * She wants a to socialise with family and loved ones.
   * She wants to engage in something that is fun.
   * She wants to make sure is doing things to stimulate her brain.

Sally thinks that an online game platform might a good way for her to connect with his family more regularly and overcome the loneliness and isolation she's been feeling since her husband's death.

### Expectations

Sally's expectations are as follows:

   * She doesn't want the games to be too difficult for her.
   * She wants to be able to see her opponent while she plays the games.
   * The layout of the website will be easy to navigate.

### Special Requirements

Sally's special requirements are:

   * Sally experiences anxiety, so she doesn't want to feel overwhelmed by the interface.
   * Sally's hearing isn't particularly good so if there is audio she wants it to be loud.

Tailoring the design of the product to meet these needs would, therefore, be beneficial to sally's experience.

## Product manager

The third stakeholder is a product manager called Jack Barnett. As with the end-users, his background and interest in the project is listed below.

___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/manager_jack_profile.jpg)

</div>

### Motivations

Jack, 36, is a product manager. In his role as a product manager, he is responsible for setting the strategy and vision of a product. He also advises on the development methodology, evaluating ideas and feedback from end-users and other stakeholders, and making sure those views are integrated into the development process. His aim is to do this as seamlessly as possible. His motivations are as follows:

   * He wants to deliver a good product to the end-users.
   * He wants to create added value and improve the quality of life of the end-users.

He also advises teams on prioritising features and setting weekly goals and targets. For our purposes, he will be advising us throughout the development process.

### Expectations

Jack's expectations are as follows:

   * That the group will use the Agile methodology as best they can, that they will communicate regularly.
   * That the group aim to produce a minimum viable product as soon as they can.
   * He expects the group to make sure that the needs of the end-user are put above all else.

Meeting these expectations is important for our project since the advise of the product manager is valuable since he is experienced and well-informed on the processes surrounding the development lifecycle and best practice.


## Sponsor

Our final stakeholder is called Simon Sharma. His background and requirements are listed below.

___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/user_simon_profile.jpg)

</div>

### Motivations

Simon, 69, is the manager of a local care home. He has first-hand experience of the needs of our target audience, namely older adults, and he knows the potential of using games to enhance their wellbeing. He has been a regular gamer for many years, and he firmly believes it is one of best form of entertainment. His main motivations are as follows:

   * He wants to use our product to help improve the lives of the residents in the care home he manages.
   * He would like to use the platform himself to further cultivate close relationships with the care home residents.

His feedback during the sprint cycles is invaluable, since he not only understands the wants and desires of older adults, but also, as an older adult with an interest in online games, he is well placed to advise on the type of user interface that would be most effective.

### Expectations

Simon's expectations are as follows:

   * The group will embrace the project using the Agile methodology.
   * That the group listen to the stakeholders throughout the build.
   * The games are presented in a clear way and are challenging enough.
   * He expects multiplayer mode and video chat.

As with the other stakeholders, tailoring the design of the product to meet these expectations would be beneficial to our stakeholders' interaction with and experience of the product.

## UX approach - design methods

When considering the UX approach, we felt it was important to choose something tried and tested, which we could rely on to guide us. For this reason we chose to use the 'ten commandments' articulated by Jakob Nielson and Rold Molich in their famous paper "Improving a Human-Computer Dialogue"[**6**](#references). In this paper, the authors claim that there are a set of principles (referred to as heuristics) which people in industry can use and adopt to make an informed assessment of their human-computer interaction. Let's explore this in more depth.

### Design heuristics

Before explaining our design method, we should define what a heuristic is. A heuristic is a quick, effective way to solve a problem or decide on a particular course of action. It's a practical shortcut which is known to work. In the context of UX design, professionals can assess a design or products' usability by means of heuristics. These heuristics are contained within a criteria or list of questions to ask so as to identify limitations and faults with the design. This helps to catch any issues which may have been overlooked by the team responsible for UX and UI design.

```
   1. Keep users informed about its status appropriately and promptly.
   2. Show information in ways users understand from how the real world operates, and in the users’ language.
   3. Offer users control and let them undo errors easily.
   4. Be consistent so users aren’t confused over what different words, icons, etc. mean.
   5. Prevent errors – a system should either avoid conditions where errors arise or warn users before they take risky actions (e.g., “Are you sure you want to do this?” messages).
   6. Have visible information, instructions, etc. to let users recognise options, actions, etc. instead of forcing them to rely on memory.
   7. Be flexible so experienced users find faster ways to attain goals.
   8. Have no clutter, containing only relevant information for current tasks.
   9. Provide plain-language help regarding errors and solutions.
   10. List concise steps in lean, searchable documentation for overcoming problems.
```

These criteria will be used to conduct a heuristic evaluation of our product's design. Before moving on to our evaluation of the design, let's consider some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.

<table>
<tr>
  <th>The Pros</th>
  <th>The Cons</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>- Evaluators can focus directly on specific issues, flag them and find optimal solutions <br /> - Evaluators can identify faults with individual elements and determine their impact on the overall UX  <br /> - Compared to testing on users, you can obtain feedback without ethical issues and costs. </td>
  <td>- Evaluators' insights are subjective; findings can lack proof and be biased <br /> - Finding several evaluators may be hard and expensive  <br />- Evaluators can identify issues that aren't usability problems </td>
</tr>
</table>


## Game design for older people

For a better insight into the usability requirements for our target users, we must now look at design requirements. A digital game for the elderly should be designed with the needs of the target user in mind. In particular, it is important to design the game according to the technical competence of the user and familiarity with digital interfaces and online platforms. There are, of course, mental and physical impairments associated with old age such as loss of hearing, vision, motor movement and cognitive abilities both in terms of memory and executive function. Older adults tend to have slower response times to game stimuli.

In light of these user requirements, we can tailor our approach. For this, it is useful to turn to research on the design of digital games. Ijsselsteijn et al () conducted research on the design of digital games for the elderly from the perspective of health and psychology. In this work, the authors stress the importance of going beyond typical usability requirements to account for the wide range of abilities and impairments in the 70+ age group.
Some of the suggestions include:

- Using a game for social and educational purposes
- For relaxation and entertainment
- Motivation for sharpening the mind
- Encouraging physical activity

Similarly, Wang () suggests a very similar set of design requirements.
