# UX Design

In this section, we discuss the design of our app. We start with the initial to our working app. We include details about some users and their interests. We also explain the interface before looking at areas where we could have developed the product.

## UX Design

With regard to the UX design, we decided to...

### Design Process and ideation


Below is a picture of a mind map created for our project ideation phase. The mind map shows the different types of games we were considering when trying to determine what board game to build.

Here is a mind map of the different real world issues and problems we were considering. The idea here was to combine a real world issue/problem with a particular type of game to generate a a board game for our SPA.

The following are photos of the ideas matrix we used to generate ideas for the application. Different types of games are in the rows and different types of real-world issues are in the columns.

As you can see, the rows are populated with different types of games. These include 'unforgiving games' 'card games' 'guessing games' and 'educational games'. Along the columns there are different real-world issues such as 'political issues' 'mental health issues' and 'learning english'.

When identifying the users and stakeholders we took the decision to...

## Game design for older people

A digital game for the elderly should be designed with the needs of the target user in mind. In particular, it is important to design the game according to the technical competence of the user and familiarity with digital interfaces and online platforms. There are, of course, mental and physical impairments associated with old age such as loss of hearing, vision, motor movement and cognitive abilities both in terms of memory and executive function. Older adults tend to have slower response times to game stimuli.

In light of these user requirements, we can tailor our approach. For this, it is useful to turn to research on the design of digital games. Ijsselsteijn et al () conducted research on the design of digital games for the elderly from the perspective of health and psychology. In this work, the authors stress the importance of going beyond typical usability requirements to account for the wide range of abilities and impairments in the 70+ age group.
Some of the suggestions include:

- Using a game for social and educational purposes
- For relaxation and entertainment
- Motivation for sharpening the mind
- Encouraging physical activity

Similarly, Wang () suggests a very similar set of design requirements.



## UX approach - design methods

When considering the UX approach we felt it was important to choose something that was relevant and of genuine importance. As such, we honed in on major issues facing society. After drafting two project proposals we decided that NotSoBored Games was the best project given the constraints of time, skills and resources we had to design and implement the application.
