# Conclusion

In this final section, we reflect on our application and how far we've come. We start by reflecting on our working practices, evaluating strengths and weaknesses. We the go on to reflect on the success of the project, with a focus on whether the brief and objectives were met. We then assess the impact Covid-19 had on our project. Finally, we discuss the social and ethical implications of our product and look ahead to future work in terms of design, development and evaluation, and the impact of our work more generally.

## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices...


### Our working practices

Throughout the project the team was well organised and attended meetings often. This allowed for good discussion on weekly progress and helped keep the team motivated with a clear direction. Furthermore, this allowed us to allocate people to specific tasks and avoid any crossovers. We also thoroughly documented our [discussions](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Team_Meetings.md) so that everyone could see the expectations and tasks.

With the use of Microsoft Teams and Discord we were able to communicate effectively between each other. Our use of the group chat was effective for not only troubleshooting but highlighting progress. This helped the team easily see the lifecycle of the project and kept us all motivated.

The Agile approach suited our project really well and helped everyone manage their workload effectively alongside other university work. With clear and defined tasks allocated to each of us we were able to easily follow the model. Our sprints were effective and well documented and clearly showed the progress made as our app came to life.

The sprints……

### Evaluation of working practices



## Reflection of success of project

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit.


### How well did our project fulfil the brief?


### Were objectives met?

To reflect on whether our project objectives were met, let's turn to the objectives we set ourselves and assess whether each of these was met. Consider the first of these:

  * ***Build and deploy a responsive SPA using the MEAN stack, as per the project brief.***

With this objective, it is fair to say that we were successful.


  * ***Implement a login, leaderboard and two board games with multiplayer functionality and video chat.***

With this objective, we.

  * ***Conduct extensive user testing through the development lifecycle, in line with the agile framework, to ensure the product meets the needs of the end-user.***

With this objective, we.

  * ***Explore the effectiveness of this platform for improving states of wellbeing in end-users through user testing and self-report questionnaires.***

We were unable to complete this objective due to the time constraints placed on us. Despite the face we were unable to meet this objective, we believe this could be a really fruitful extension of our product since it could help garner useful data on the impact our platform has with respect to subjective feelings of wellbeing and self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation. Whilst these questions lie outside the realm of this project, they nonetheless could be addressed in a small-scale study investigating those phenomena.

  * ***Deliver a SPA that is easy to use and is inclusive of older adults with lower levels of digital literacy.***

With this objective, it is fair to say that we were successful.

### How did we 'serious play' in our application?

As discussed in the background and UX design sections of this report,

## Impact of Covid-19

We now turn to a discussion of the impact of Covid-19. In this section we will give a subjective account of how the pandemic affected our lives and in particular how it impacted our studies in general and the software engineering project in particular.

### How Covid-19 affected our project

The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. It is to this topic we now turn our attention. In particular, we will cover the main ways in which the pandemic affected our project.

The first major impact was communication. Specifically, Covid-19 prevented us from meeting in person. This meant that we were reliant on communication platforms to not only talk about the project but work collaboratively on the coding side of things. The second issue we faced was the stress component of the pandemic. Not only did we feel increased levels of stress due to the existential threat of the virus, we also found that the masters conversion was especially challenging given that we had so few face-to-face interactions with tutors, TAs and other students. This certainly had an impact on the experience of the masters.

In relation to our group project,


## Social and ethical implications

TO DO: edit this + add more implications

Ethical issues concerning data privacy and security of our prototype were addressed by our team, particularly during the later stages of the project.

### Our ethical responsibilities

First, we will turn to our ethical responsibilities as moral individuals, using normative ethics. Using those insights we will explain the ethical framework we used to guide us throughout the project, before turning our attention to the social implications associated with our product and data protection.

### Normative ethics and ethical frameworks

To determine whether our approach was morally permissible, we can apply the theories of normative ethics. According to deontological and virtue ethics perspectives, our project should have complied with some ethical codes of conduct. This is because compliance with codes of conduct ensures conformity to universal rules, norms and core values, which is in accordance with deontological and virtue ethics since both theories require adherence to rules and values. Failing to adhere to these rules and values, therefore, amounts to unethical behaviour. In light of this, we decided to follow the BSC code of conduct, a value-based code of ethics for IT professionals. We decided this would be appropriate to use as an ethical framework to guide our actions and decisions during the project, and which aligns with the goals of normative ethics.

By explicitly citing this as our code of conduct, we felt that we would be more likely to avoid behaving unethically, and that if we were challenged on ethical grounds despite having followed this code of conduct, we would be able to justify our actions by referring to it. This, we felt, would be particularly important in relation to working practices concerned with the way we handled and stored people's data. In addition to this, from a consequentialist perspective, conformance to the BSC arguably produces a morally good outcome, which focuses on mitigating risk and maximising human welfare.

Further to this, took the decision to follow the W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles. According to these principles, "The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society". This captures the main idea at the heart of our ethical approach to creating our product.


### Social implications

#### Negative implications

Given that our product is an online game, we recognise that it has the capacity to be addictive for some people. What's more, we are aware that excessive use of online games is linked to a rise in mental health issues such as anxiety and depression (FIND SOURCES). A further concern is that the competitive feature of a leaderboard might serve to elevate stress levels in the players. The behavioural effect of playing more games on the platform could be viewed as operant conditioning, where behaviours are encouraged and discouraged with associated rewards and punishments (Staddon, 2003, p. 116), in this case winning and losing. It could also demotivate people from doing outdoor activities, and as such might decentivise healthy behaviours. Too much screen time can also be cause eye strain.

Whilst these considerations are important to bear in mind, it is not clear whether there would be a clear causal link between playing our game and increased levels of negative emotions. The most we could reasonably speculate is that there could be a correlation. Notwithstanding this point, these social implications would be concerning enough to merit consideration and draw up a protocol for dealing with. Since our product is still in its early stages there is no need to explore these options, however it is worth bearing them in mind and ways to address any possible issues which might arise.

#### Positive implications

Despite the potential for negative outcomes when playing online games, there are numerous positive outcomes which might be realised when playing our online game. Our platform is designed to fun, engaging and social. These factors can all improve a person's wellbeing. As we discussed in the section on [using games to tackle isolation and loneliness](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md#can-digital-games-help-tackle-the-health-concerns-associated-with-loneliness-and-isolation) in the Background section, online games can be very beneficial for older adults. Specifically, playing online games can leave people feeling connected with others and satisfied that they have achieved something, both of which lead to an improved sense of wellbeing.

Another issue our platform serves to address is the gap in digital literacy for older adults, as we discussed in the subsection [digital literacy](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md#digital-literacy) in the Background section of the report. Designing our application with the end-users in mind, making the UI and UX simple, straightforward, and with short, concise instructions all help to make the gaming experience as easy as possible. This is important because making a game easy makes it inclusive, and serves to bridge the digital literacy gap for the elderly. That is, it helps make the experience appropriate for our end-users and inclusive. This inclusivity is key since it then redresses the digital divide for our target users.

### Data protection

Now, turning to data protection. As moral individuals, we were aware that as computer scientists we have a professional and moral responsibility to protect personal data. Our jobs involve the protection of privacy which is a fundamental moral human right - a right that preserves autonomy and dignity [**1**](#references) which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. That's not to say it's an absolute right like the right to life; it's a qualified right, so there are extreme circumstances in which it can be infringed upon.

Given this, from design to implementation, privacy protection was of paramount importance to use. We used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as an appropriate guide to managing personal data. This complies normative ethics since in enshrines values and encourages positive outcomes. A further strength of the project concerns its approach to data protection. Specifically, the we (maybe, possibly) anonymised participants' personal data, and the software has (maybe, possibly if we have time) implementations to remove personal data if the participant so desires. This is in clear accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Despite all of this, there are certainly limitations with our product. For instance, we weren't able to focus on protect data as robustly as we would have liked. This was due to time constraints and heavy workloads. One possible extension concerns testing. In particular, the software would benefit from some more extensive testing. A possible project extension to address this limitation would be to conduct rigorous tests to determine what a hacker could manipulate, attack those vulnerabilities and then fix them [**3**](#references).

For example, a brute-force attack to guess a user password and a simple account suspension on the third incorrect entry of the password. A secure-sockets-layer (SSL) encryption to ensure data transferred between devices is encrypted and secure would have established greater data security. These nontrivial features would bolster the security of the app and make it a better candidate for future use in data gathering, which is important given the significance of privacy and security concerns in the uptake of mobile health technologies [**2**](#references). Maybe this is a little over the top though for our purposes. But regardless, we can discuss this added security as a potential feature were we to scale up this project.

## Future work

There is, we feel, a lot of scope for adding to and extending the features of our product. In particular, there

- *ADD MORE IDEAS/FLESH OUT THE IDEAS BELOW* -

### Adding more games

One possible extension concerns adding more games to the platform. When we began this project we planned to have four games to choose from. However, after scoping the project we realised that this was too ambitious. Instead, we decided it would be better to deploy a fully-functioning MVP with two games at an early stage in the agile cycle than to deploy one with four games at the very end of the the lifecycle. There is also scope to go beyond four games, and add a number of different games with different gaming categories such as cognitively challenging games, memory games, fun games, social games, cooperative games.

However, this extension would have to be moderated since the core idea behind our application is to connect older adults together and make sure that that the platform is easy enough to use so that their lower levels of digital literacy don't exclude them from using our product.


### Invite friends to play

Another extension concerns adding an 'invite friends to play' feature.


### Adding better instructions

A further extension concerns

- *ADD MORE IDEAS* -


## Impact of our work

There are several ways our work will have an impact...

One potential impact of our work concerns its application in research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly population. In particular, our product could be used to garner data on the affect playing our application could have on individuals who self-report as lonely and isolated. Although we lacked the time and resources to conduct research, one potential future area of work which our product could be applied to is research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly. Specifically researchers could conduct a small-scale study in which users' self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation are measured over a set period of time. As Alan (1999) points out, this type of hypothesis testing is an indispensable part of research since it allows researchers to test hypotheses and determine the contribution of certain independent and dependent variables. One future use of our application, therefore, could involve assessing the affects of our product on subjective feelings of loneliness in older adults. This is an area of research which our product could have been put to good use. The ubiquity of computers and smartphones and the self-centric orientation of their technologies capable of connecting individuals from across the globe indicates that multiplayer games with video functionality could play an important role in future research on loneliness in older adults.


Building upon contemporary gaming platforms, this project pushes the field forward and provides a promising point of departure for future methods.
