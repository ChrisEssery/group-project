# Conclusion

In this final section, we reflect on our application and how far we've come. We start by reflecting on our working practices, evaluating strengths and weaknesses. We the go on to reflect on the success of the project, with a focus on whether the brief and objectives were met. We then assess the impact Covid-19 had on our project. Finally, we discuss the social and ethical implications of our product and look ahead to future work in terms of design, development and evaluation, and the impact of our work more generally.

## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices. In particular, we discuss our main lines of communication, application of the Agile methodology, and management of sprints, as well as assess how we used GitHub and worked as a team.


### Our working practices

Throughout the project the team was well organised and attended meetings often. This allowed for good discussion on weekly progress and helped keep the team motivated with a clear direction. Furthermore, this allowed us to allocate people to specific tasks and avoid any crossovers. We also thoroughly documented our [discussions](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Team_Meetings.md) so that everyone could see the expectations and tasks.

With the use of Microsoft Teams and Discord we were able to communicate effectively between each other. Our use of the group chat was effective for not only troubleshooting but highlighting progress. This helped the team easily see the lifecycle of the project and kept us all motivated.

The Agile approach suited our project really well and helped everyone manage their workload effectively alongside other university work. With clear and defined tasks allocated to each of us we were able to easily follow the model. Our sprints were effective and well documented and clearly showed the progress made as our app came to life.

### Microsoft Teams & Discord

Throughout the project we had strong communication between team members through the use of Microsoft Teams. Initially we tried also using the Discord platform and it was useful to share ideas however Microsoft Teams became the main area of team communication.

Microsoft Teams was an excellent platform and we used the group chat effectively for troubleshooting, highlighting progress and further organisation. The individual chats were helpful for team members working closely together on the app or communicating changes being done on the Git repo.

We also had all our meetings on Teams with most of them running smoothly. We would always encourage the use of the camera’s which rarely caused any trouble on the platform. The share feature was also very smooth and allowed team members to show off their progress with ease.

For the most part Teams was very suitable to our project. However, there were occasional issues with the connection to Teams for different members. Also, it noticeably reduced the performance of your laptop which did make it tough for Team members to use while they have a lot of processes running.

Overall, Microsoft Teams was a very good platform for our collaboration throughout the project given the COVID circumstances. This alongside the effectiveness of our Team members made communication seamless. It may be worth exploring other platforms but for the most part Teams is good choice when it comes to group work.

### Agile and Jira

The Agile approach suited our project really well and helped everyone manage their workload effectively alongside other university work. With clear and defined tasks allocated to each of us we were able to easily approach weekly sprints. Furthermore, we could analyse what was completed and how it would affect our stakeholders before we moved onto future sprints.

Our use of proto-personas to create user stories, as detailed in the section on [UX Design](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/UX_Design.md), proved very helpful during our sprints, since they forced us to implement user stories. This motivated us to prioritise tasks and implement key features each week, and use the proto-personas as a way to reflect on the design and functionality of those features which would shed light on any design issues. This meant that we could apportion enough time for each feature, so that we weren't focusing on any particular part of the product.

We also utilized the Jira software effectively for our sprints. We started by laying out the tasks needed in the ‘To Do’ section. This was a rough draft and some tasks were broken up into multiples later. We then allocated team members in our meetings and moved to the ‘In Progress’ section once they had started. Finally, we could tick of and move tasks to the ‘Done’ pane once team members had progressed. Whilst Jira was helpful, some issues were noted in the way that tasks could still remain even when the sprint had ended. This was minor however and the task would just be added to future sprints. Overall, the platform was very helpful in getting the team organised and added motivation from seeing the tasks being ticked off one by one.

Utilizing the Agile method alongside Jira really helped the team progress, the flexibility meant that we could chip away at tasks while balancing other workloads. Coupling this with Jira meant that our sprints were incredibly effective, well documented and the team could clearly see the progress as our app came to life.

### Sprints

With the help of Jira and Microsoft Teams the sprints were made very easy. At the start of each sprint we would allocate people to different tasks depending on their direction. Noting team member tasks in the meeting minutes we could then move them over to Jira to begin the sprint.

We would then regroup the following week with the current progress. The team members could share what they’ve done whilst the others give encouragement and discuss improvements. We could also discuss the user and stake holder feedback that we would expect should a player of our game use the app at that moment in time.

Overall, the sprints were managed very effectively. The team did an amazing job to chip away at the work week by week. This meant we weren’t scrambling at the end of the project to get everything done. It allowed us more time for further documentation and to add any extra simple features.

### Github

Throughout our project we utilised the version control system known as Github. Github was really important throughout the project. Not only did it hold copies of everything we’d ever done but it complemented our sprints allowing the team to work independently of each other.

The team was really effective in its use of Github. There were frequent commits on all branches allowing for good version control habits. The team could push forward knowing that their work was always backed-up. This gave us confidence to keep moving forward knowing that any major mistakes could just result in a simple git revert.

Once team members were assigned some of the bigger tasks, they could create their own branches to work in. Team members wouldn’t then clash if issues arose. Many branches were created specifically for the individual games, MongoDB, API building and testing. We could then bring all our branches together under the dev branch and see our app take shape. Whilst effective, this methodology was not greatly organised and we did feel by the end of the project that we had too many branches. It did also impact the merging to our ‘dev’ branch and we needed good communication to avoid any clashes. This is an aspect we could look to improve moving forward in our work practices.

There were also certain GitHub features that we didn't utilise which would have helped us. For instance, milestones. Milestones serve to track groups of pull requests and issues in a repository. This would have further improved our prioritisation of tasks. Also, as discussed in [Sprints & Project Management](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Sprints_Project_Management.md), we may have also benefited from one team member becoming the GitHub expert who could then be relied on to teach the other team members how to use the platform, and offer expert advice on any issues we encountered. This would have helped us use the platform more effectively and overcome GitHub-related problems more quickly.

Overall, Github was incredibly useful and was easily the most important software used on the project. It gave team members a comfortable place to work in their own branches where others didn’t interfere. The version control was managed very well by the team and we never had any major issues merging across our changes. We would be happy and confident to utilise Github again.

### Teamwork, Communication & Organisation

The team itself was a great mix of abilities and interests. All team members were very engaging and positive which really helped us establish early ideas of our app. This made decisions very easy and we could clearly see a direction to head in early on.

We discussed the team roles early on to get a good idea of what each of us wanted to be working on. This allowed us to assign members to work on the tutorials which aligned with their interests. These did diverge slightly throughout the life of the project but had no repercussions. Everyone was content with the aspects of the project they chose to do. This really helped the team members push beyond their expectations.

Throughout the project the team were well organised and attended meetings often. The communication was also excellent with all members being very responsive. This made the collaboration easy which reflected well on our projects progress. We effectively documented all our team meetings in detail which you can find [here](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Team_Meetings.md).

The team was also excellent on a human level. No-one ever felt outcast and everyone was always supportive and respectful of each other. With this positivity we could easily crack on with the work with little pressure.

### Evaluation of working practices



## Reflection of success of project

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit. One of the first hurdles we faced as a team was that we started the project one team member down. That is, instead of having five team members, as was intended, we had four. This presented a few challenges. Firstly, there were fewer of us to complete the project which meant that each individual team member had, in theory, more work to complete. Secondly, this meant that our project had to be scaled back to account for a smaller team. As such, there were certain features we inevitably were unable to implement. The way we dealt with being one team member down was arguably a success, since we did not dwell on the fact but simply moved forward with a positive mindset, aware of how much we could achieve if we remained focused and goal-oriented.

With this in mind, we feel proud of how far we have come. In particular, we feel proud of how we have worked as a team to produce a working prototype based on an idea which arose during the ideation phase. As a team, we have managed to work well together, making sure to keep in contact every day, and to follow a structured approach to the completion of sprints.

We also feel that we successfully designated roles to each team member, which we maintained throughout the project.

### Back-End



### Front-End



### Design



### How well did our project fulfil the brief?


### Were objectives met?

To reflect on whether our project objectives were met, let's turn to the objectives we set ourselves and assess whether each of these was met. Consider the first of these:

  * ***Build and deploy a responsive SPA using the MEAN stack, as per the project brief.***

With this objective, it is fair to say that we were successful.


  * ***Implement a login, leaderboard and two board games with multiplayer functionality and video chat.***

With this objective, we.

  * ***Conduct extensive user testing through the development lifecycle, in line with the agile framework, to ensure the product meets the needs of the end-user.***

With this objective, we.

  * ***Explore the effectiveness of this platform for improving states of wellbeing in end-users through user testing and self-report questionnaires.***

We were unable to complete this objective due to the time constraints placed on us. Despite the face we were unable to meet this objective, we believe this could be a really fruitful extension of our product since it could help garner useful data on the impact our platform has with respect to subjective feelings of wellbeing and self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation. Whilst these questions lie outside the realm of this project, they nonetheless could be addressed in a small-scale study investigating those phenomena. The PENS model, discussed in [the Background section of this report](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md), could be used to inform the questions asked of the participants of that study.

  * ***Deliver a SPA that is easy to use and is inclusive of older adults with lower levels of digital literacy.***

With this objective, it is fair to say that we were successful.

### How did we 'serious play' in our application?

As discussed in the background and UX design sections of this report,

## Impact of Covid-19

We now turn to a discussion of the impact of Covid-19. In this section we will give a subjective account of how the pandemic affected our lives and in particular how it impacted our studies in general and the software engineering project in particular.

### How Covid-19 affected our project

The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. It is to this topic we now turn our attention. In particular, we will cover the main ways in which the pandemic affected our project.

The first major impact was communication. Specifically, Covid-19 prevented us from meeting in person. As a result, we were reliant on communication platforms to not only talk about the project but work collaboratively on the coding and documentation side of things. The other issue we faced during this time was the stress component of the pandemic. Not only did we feel increased levels of stress due to the existential threat of the virus, but we also found that the MSc conversion was especially challenging given we had no face-to-face interactions with tutors, TAs or fellow students in the second term.

In relation to our group project,


## Social and ethical implications

Ethical issues concerning data privacy and security of our prototype were addressed by our team throughout the project. Let's consider these.

### Our ethical responsibilities

First, we will turn to our ethical responsibilities as moral individuals, using normative ethics. Using those insights we will explain the ethical framework we used to guide us throughout the project, before turning our attention to the social implications associated with our product and data protection.

### Normative ethics and ethical frameworks

To determine whether our approach was morally permissible, we can apply the theories of normative ethics. According to deontological and virtue ethics perspectives, our project should have complied with some ethical codes of conduct. This is because compliance with codes of conduct ensures conformity to universal rules, norms and core values, which is in accordance with deontological and virtue ethics since both theories require adherence to rules and values. Failing to adhere to these rules and values, therefore, amounts to unethical behaviour. In light of this, we decided to follow the [BSC code of conduct, a value-based code of ethics for IT professionals](https://www.bcs.org/membership/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct/). We decided this would be appropriate to use as an ethical framework to guide our actions and decisions during the project, and which aligns with the goals of normative ethics.

By explicitly citing this as our code of conduct, we felt that we would be more likely to avoid behaving unethically, and that if we were challenged on ethical grounds despite having followed this code of conduct, we would be able to justify our actions by referring to it. This, we felt, would be particularly important in relation to working practices concerned with the way we handled and stored people's data. In addition to this, from a consequentialist perspective, conformance to the BSC arguably produces a morally good outcome, which focuses on mitigating risk and maximising human welfare.

Further to this, took the decision to follow the W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles. According to these principles, "The web should empower an equitable, informed and interconnected society". This captures the main idea at the heart of our ethical approach to creating our product.


### Social implications

#### Negative implications

Given that our product is an online game, we recognise that it has the capacity to be addictive for some people. What's more, we are aware that excessive use of online games is linked to a rise in mental health issues such as anxiety and depression (FIND SOURCES). A further concern is that the competitive feature of a leaderboard might serve to elevate stress levels in the players. The behavioural effect of playing more games on the platform could be viewed as operant conditioning, where behaviours are encouraged and discouraged with associated rewards and punishments (Staddon, 2003, p. 116), in this case winning and losing. It could also demotivate people from doing outdoor activities, and as such might decentivise healthy behaviours. Too much screen time can also be cause eye strain.

Whilst these considerations are important to bear in mind, it is not clear whether there would be a clear causal link between playing our game and increased levels of negative emotions. The most we could reasonably speculate is that there could be a correlation. Notwithstanding this point, these social implications would be concerning enough to merit consideration and draw up a protocol for dealing with. Since our product is still in its early stages there is no need to explore these options, however it is worth bearing them in mind and ways to address any possible issues which might arise.

#### Positive implications

Despite the potential for negative outcomes when playing online games, there are numerous positive outcomes which might be realised when playing our online game. Our platform is designed to fun, engaging and social. These factors can all improve a person's wellbeing. As we discussed in the section on [using games to tackle isolation and loneliness](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md#can-digital-games-help-tackle-the-health-concerns-associated-with-loneliness-and-isolation) in the Background section, online games can be very beneficial for older adults. Specifically, playing online games can leave people feeling connected with others and satisfied that they have achieved something, both of which lead to an improved sense of wellbeing.

Another issue our platform serves to address is the gap in digital literacy for older adults, as we discussed in the subsection [digital literacy](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md#digital-literacy) in the Background section of the report. Designing our application with the end-users in mind, making the UI and UX simple, straightforward, and with short, concise instructions all help to make the gaming experience as easy as possible. This is important because making a game easy makes it inclusive, and serves to bridge the digital literacy gap for the elderly. That is, it helps make the experience appropriate for our end-users and inclusive. This inclusivity is key since it then redresses the digital divide for our target users.

### Data protection

Now, turning to data protection. As moral individuals, we were aware that as computer scientists we have a professional and moral responsibility to protect personal data. Our jobs involve the protection of privacy which is a fundamental moral human right - a right that preserves autonomy and dignity [**1**](#references) which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. That's not to say it's an absolute right like the right to life; it's a qualified right, so there are extreme circumstances in which it can be infringed upon.

Given this, from design to implementation, privacy protection was of paramount importance to use. We used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as an appropriate guide to managing personal data. This complies normative ethics since in enshrines values and encourages positive outcomes. A further strength of the project concerns its approach to data protection. Specifically, the we (maybe, possibly) anonymised participants' personal data, and the software has (maybe, possibly if we have time) implementations to remove personal data if the participant so desires. This is in clear accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Despite all of this, there are certainly limitations with our product. For instance, we weren't able to focus on protect data as robustly as we would have liked. This was due to time constraints and heavy workloads. One possible extension concerns testing. In particular, the software would benefit from some more extensive testing. A possible project extension to address this limitation would be to conduct rigorous tests to determine what a hacker could manipulate, attack those vulnerabilities and then fix them [**3**](#references).

For example, a brute-force attack to guess a user password and a simple account suspension on the third incorrect entry of the password. A secure-sockets-layer (SSL) encryption to ensure data transferred between devices is encrypted and secure would have established greater data security. These nontrivial features would bolster the security of the app and make it a better candidate for future use in data gathering, which is important given the significance of privacy and security concerns in the uptake of mobile health technologies [**2**](#references). Maybe this is a little over the top though for our purposes. But regardless, we can discuss this added security as a potential feature were we to scale up this project.

## Future work

There is, we feel, a lot of scope for adding to and extending the features of our product. In particular, there

- *ADD MORE IDEAS/FLESH OUT THE IDEAS BELOW* -

### Adding more games
EDIT
One possible extension concerns adding more games to the platform. When we began this project we planned to have four games to choose from. However, after scoping the project we realised that this was too ambitious. Instead, we decided it would be better to deploy a fully-functioning MVP with two games at an early stage in the agile cycle than to deploy one with four games at the very end of the the lifecycle. There is also scope to go beyond four games, and add a number of different games with different gaming categories such as cognitively challenging games, memory games, fun games, social games, cooperative games.

However, this extension would have to be moderated since the core idea behind our application is to connect older adults together and make sure that that the platform is easy enough to use so that their lower levels of digital literacy don't exclude them from using our product.

Firstly, expanding on the multiplayer of our app would be paramount upon releasing of the app to the public. The app currently does not include any form of matchmaking and is limited to just two players within one gaming session. Obviously, the implementation of the matchmaking is too substantial to be fully implemented due to the time constraints. This is a good step to take the app forward should it be released to the public.

Another aspect of the app which could be further extended is the selection of games. Originally we were expecting around four games to try to incorporate into our app. However, alongside working in the video and other functionality this was not feasible. The flexibility of our app allows us to easily add more games for the users to enjoy and would be a great direction to expand on.

### Difficulty level

It’s important for the end=users to find games that are challenging but not so difficult that they don't want to play. If you’re looking for brain games for a loved one who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease, for instance, you’ll want to choose brain exercises and games that aren’t impossible to complete at their current cognitive level. Start slowly with some beginner puzzles and gradually progress to harder puzzles for more challenging problem-solving tasks. With the memory game, we could have added a difficulty level feature which enables the player to choose the number of cards to play with, where a lower number of cards is easier than a higher number. As it currently stands, the default is 20 cards. On reflection, this would likely be too diffi

### Invite friends to play

Another extension concerns adding an 'invite friends to play' feature.


### Add competition feature and rewards

Another possible extension concerns adding a competition feature whereby players can create contests among friends and/or simply compete against friends to win rewards. there are monthly contests and competitions...or something along those lines.

### Adding better instructions

A further extension concerns

- *ADD MORE IDEAS* -

### Expansion of front-end and back-end testing

Our app could also be improved via the expansion of our front-end functional testing. Currently you can see the outline of our testing for the front-end below. Whilst this covers a good range of the components on our app we have not been able to test the individual game components thoroughly. It would be nice to expand on this for further robustness prior to release.


## Impact of our work

There are several ways our work will have an impact...

One potential impact of our work concerns its application in research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly population. In particular, our product could be used to garner data on the affect playing our application could have on individuals who self-report as lonely and isolated. Although we lacked the time and resources to conduct research, one potential future area of work which our product could be applied to is research on loneliness and isolation in the elderly. Specifically researchers could conduct a small-scale study in which users' self-reported levels of loneliness and isolation are measured over a set period of time. As Alan (1999) points out, this type of hypothesis testing is an indispensable part of research since it allows researchers to test hypotheses and determine the contribution of certain independent and dependent variables. One future use of our application, therefore, could involve assessing the affects of our product on subjective feelings of loneliness in older adults. This is an area of research which our product could have been put to good use. The ubiquity of computers and smartphones and the self-centric orientation of their technologies capable of connecting individuals from across the globe indicates that multiplayer games with video functionality could play an important role in future research on loneliness in older adults.


Building upon contemporary gaming platforms, this project pushes the field forward and provides a promising point of departure for future methods.
