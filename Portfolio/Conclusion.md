# Evaluation

In this final section we reflect on our app and how far we've come. We start by evaluating the design of the app, looking at the strengths, weaknesses and lessons learned. We reflect on our working practices and successes and finally we discuss the social and ethical implications of our product and future work.

## Evaluation of design

When it came to the design of the project we felt... with this in mind, we will now evaluate the strengths, weaknesses and potential extensions of the design before reflecting on the lessons we've learned about this aspect of the project.


## Reflection on working practices

We now turn to our working practices...


## Reflection of successes

There have been many successes throughout the duration of this unit.


## Social and ethical implications

Ethical issues concerning data privacy and security of the prototype software were addressed particularly at the later stages of the project.

To determine whether the approach was morally permissible, we can apply the theories of normative ethics. According to deontological and virtue ethics perspectives, our project should comply with ethical codes of conduct. One such code of conduct is the BSC code of conduct, a value-based code of ethics for IT professionals. As such, we decided to use this an ethical framework to guide our actions and decisions during the project. It also ensures conformity to universal rules, norms and core values, which is in clear accordance with deontological and virtue ethics since these ethical theories require adherence to rules and values. Failing to adhere to these rules and values amounts to unethical behaviour.

By explicitly citing this code of conduct, we felt that at a later stage were we to be challenged to defend any criticisms on ethical grounds, we would be able to that, particularly in relation to working practices and the way in which we handled and stored. In addition to this, from a consequentialist perspective, conformance to the BSC can be seen as producing a morally good outcome, thereby mitigating risk and maximising human welfare.

Now, turning to data protection. As moral agents, we were aware that as computer scientists we have a professional and moral responsibility to protect personal data. The reason is simple. Our jobs involve the protection of privacy which is a fundamental moral human right. This is a right that preserves autonomy and dignity (Brey, 2007, p. 34) which is of paramount importance when dealing with stakeholders. That's not to say it's an absolute right like the right to life; it's a qualified right, so there are extreme circumstances in which it can be infringed upon.

Given this, from design to implementation, privacy protection was of paramount importance to use. We used the ‘The International Data Privacy Principles' (IDPPs) as an appropriate guide to managing personal data. This complies normative ethics since in enshrines values and encourages positive outcomes.

A further strength of the project concerns its approach to data protection. Specifically, the author anonymised participants' personal data, and the software has implementations to remove personal data if the participant so desires. This is in clear accordance with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Despite all of this, there are certainly limitations with our product. For instance, we weren't able to focus on protect data as robustly as we would have liked. This was due to time constraints and heavy workloads.

One possible extension concerns testing. In particular, the software would benefit from some more extensive testing. A possible project extension to address this limitation would be to conduct rigorous tests to determine what a hacker could manipulate, attack those vulnerabilities and then fix them (Votipka, 2018, p. 374).

For example, a brute-force attack to guess a user password and a simple account suspension on the third incorrect entry of the password. A secure-sockets-layer (SSL) encryption to ensure data transferred between devices is encrypted and secure would have established greater data security. These nontrivial features would bolster the security of the app and make it a better candidate for future use in data gathering, which is important given the significance of privacy and security concerns in the uptake of mobile health technologies (Hung, 2013, p. 432).

## Future work

There is, we feel, a lot of scope for future work in this area. In particular...
