# Background and Motivation

In this section we discuss the background literature, state-of-the-art survey and motivation and problem definition of the app. We start with the background literature on the topic of isolation and loneliness in our ageing society, and look at how games can be used to combat these issues. We then go on to present our state of the art survey of current applications used to address these issues, before explaining the problem definition and motivation behind our product.

## Background literature

In what follows, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to social isolation and loneliness among older people. We define key terms and identify public health concerns and current interventions.

According to recent figures, around 50% of people over the age of 60 will face social isolation and around 33% will experience some level of loneliness during the remaining period of their lives [[**1**]](#references). These figures point to a growing public health issue affecting older members of the population - one that is likely to continue with the growing size of our ageing society, both in the UK and internationally.

### Defining key terms

Now, let's define key terms. Following Valtora and Hanratty, we define loneliness as both a social and emotional phenomenon. According to this definition, social loneliness refers to a "subjective negative feeling associated with a lack of social network", and emotional loneliness refers to the "absence of a specific companion"[[**2**]](#references).

Social isolation, Valtora and Hanratt claim, has multiple dimensions. According to this definition, social isolation refers to a lack of social interactions with friends, family, and the community [[**2**]](#references).

Our target group is adults above the age 70. However, we acknowledge that individuals who fall short of this boundary would also benefit from the social engagement derived from playing our game. And for our user testing we asked a wide range of users to test our prototype and provide their feedback in our user test survey (see [here](#user-testing) for the results of that survey).

### Public health concerns

There are several public health concerns linked to loneliness and isolation. First, let's look at health issues. The health issues associated with loneliness and isolation range from These health issues include...

Second, mental health issues with increased levels of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. This is a very significant effect of isolation which is closely interconnected with health issues since the adverse effects of poor mental health often impact upon a person's physical health due to a lack motivation to prioritise self-care as well as less desire to go outside leading to melatonin suppression which is linked to insomnia. There is also an increased likelihood for depression which can lead to suicidal ideation, a weakened immune system due to a bad diet and lack of exercise, heart disease and high blood pressure.

The third public health concern is cognitive decline. As with the previous two health concerns, cognitive decline is intimately tied to poor mental and physical health. Find some references to back these claims up.

## State of the art survey

We now turn to a state of the art survey. After reviewing the state of the art technologies used we discovered that...

Digital games have proven to be a very useful tool for helping the older population with social, emotional and cognitive benefits. Provide references.

Pete: Provide examples of the "current solutions out there/trends/relations between what already exists, and what's the gap in the market/research that you're addressing."

According to Pete, we need to outline how our app differs from these apps. We also need to mention a handful of outliers or novel approaches too that may be under the radar, explain how they're important, then perhaps discuss any relevant academic papers (say if there were an interesting machine learning approach.

We can discuss the benefits of adding increased level of difficulty, and how we will (possibly?) try and incorporate this into the web app.

The level of difficulty of our chosen games is something to bear in mind since research shows that playing more challenging games yields greater benefits than setting the game at a level that is too easy. For instance, Kaufman et al have shown that "playing  at  an  intermediate  and  advanced level can provide greater benefits than playing at a beginner level since the cognitive demands are greater" [[**3**]](#references). Whilst this indicates that the game difficulty ideally should be challenging, it's worth bearing in mind that the game also has to be enjoyable and fun. So, with that in mind, it we would need to carefully decide on a baseline difficulty that would have benefits without the drawbacks associated with a game that is too difficult to even enjoy.


## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition, we felt it was important to combat an issue that was both relevant and of real importance. As such, we decided social isolation and loneliness in the elderly would be a good target problem since these are pressing issues in modern times for which there are few available online tools designed to address these issues.

According to research by Kaufman et al, digital games offer opportunities for older adults to socialise and engage with each other. This improves their emotional states and reduce depression, as well as having social benefits and improved cognitive performance with regard to working memory and attention [[**4**]](#references). This is something they can do without much difficulty. It is also fun, entertaining and provides real value and meaning to their lives.

Our problem definition was social isolation and loneliness in the elderly and insufficient online tools to help address these issues. Our proposed solution to this problem was to connect the elderly through an online multiplayer game designed to reduce feelings of loneliness and improve health and wellbeing.

## Motivation

The motivation behind our webpage is to create a SPA capable of combating the real-world problem of loneliness and isolation through a multiplayer online board game.

The overarching aim is to create a game that can engage the elderly through a fun, engaging platform. To realise this aim, we created a SPA that helps the elderly to connect with friends and loved ones, and enjoy some classic board games.
