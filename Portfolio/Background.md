# Background and Motivation

In this section we discuss the background literature, state-of-the-art survey and motivation and problem definition of the app. We start with the background literature on the topic of isolation and loneliness in our ageing society, and look at how games can be used to combat these issues. We then go on to present our state of the art survey before explaining the problem definition and motivation behind this product.

## Background literature

In what follows, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to social isolation and loneliness among older people. According to recent figures, around 50% of people over the age of 60 will face social isolation and around 33% will experience some level of loneliness during their later years [[**1**]](#references). These figures point to a growing public health issue affecting older members of our society - one that is likely to continue with the growing size of our ageing society, both in the UK and internationally.

### Defining key terms

Following Valtora and Hanratty, we define loneliness as both a social and emotional phenomenon. According to this definition, social loneliness refers to a "subjective negative feeling associated with a lack of social network", and emotional loneliness refers to the "absence of a specific companion"[[**2**]](#references).

Social isolation, Valtora and Hanratt claim, has multiple dimensions. According to this definition, social isolation refers to a lack of social interactions with friends, family, and the community [[**2**]](#references).

## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition, we felt it was important to combat an issue that was both relevant and of real importance. As such, we decided social isolation and loneliness in the elderly would be a good target problem since these are pressing issues in modern times for which there are few available online tools designed to address.

Our problem definition was social isolation and loneliness in the elderly and insufficient online tools to help address these issues. Our proposed solution to this problem was to connect the elderly through an online multiplayer game designed to reduce feelings of loneliness and improve health and wellbeing.

## Motivation

The motivation behind our webpage is to create a SPA capable of combating the real-world problem of loneliness and isolation through a multiplayer online board game.

The overarching aim is to create a game that can engage the elderly through a fun, engaging platform. To realise this aim, we created a SPA that helps the elderly to connect with friends and loved ones, and enjoy some classic board games.
