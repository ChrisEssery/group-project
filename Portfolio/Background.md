# Background and Motivation

In this section we discuss the background and motivation of the app. We start with the background literature on the topics of loneliness in the elderly and online multiplayer games. We then go on to present our state of the art survey. We also explain the problem definition and our motivation for creating this product.

## Background literature

In what follows, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to social isolation and loneliness among older people.

According to recent figures, around 50% of people over the age of 60 will face social isolation and around 33% will experience some level of loneliness during their later years [[**1**]](#references). These figures point to a growing public health issue affecting older members of our society - one that is likely to continue with the growing size of our ageing society, both in the UK and internationally.

### Defining key terms

Following Valtora and Hanratty, we define loneliness as having a social and emotional component. According to their definition, social loneliness refers to a "subjective negative feeling associated with a lack of social network", and emotional loneliness refers to the "absence of a specific companion"[[**2**]](#references).

Social isolation, they regard as having many dimensions. According to their definition, social isolation refers to a lack of social interactions with friends, family, and the community [[**2**]](#references).

### Public health concerns



## State of the art survey

When conducting the state of the art survey, we took the decision to...


## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition we felt it was important to choose something that was both relevant and of genuine importance. As such, we decided that isolation in the elderly would be a good target problem, since isolation is a pressing issue in modern times for which there are few available online tools designed to address.

Our problem definition was isolation in the elderly and insufficient online tools to help address this issue. Our proposed solution to this problem was to connect the elderly through an online multiplayer game which reduces feelings of loneliness in the elderly thereby improving their wellbeing.

## Motivation

The motivation behind our webpage is to create a SPA which is able to tackle a real-world problem of loneliness in leveraging a multiplayer online board game.

The overarching aim is to create a game which is able to engage the elderly through an fun, engaging platform. To realise this aim, we created an SPA which helps the elderly to reconnect and enjoy some classic games.
