# Background and Motivation

In this section, we discuss the background literature, state-of-the-art survey and problem definition of the app. We start with the background literature on the topic of isolation and loneliness in our ageing society, and look at how games can be used to combat these issues. We also focus on the idea of serious play, and how we can apply this concept to our product. We then go on to present our state of the art survey of current applications used to address these issues, before explaining the problem definition and motivation behind our product and how we intend to use serious play to address our target problem.

## Background literature

In this section, we provide an overview of the background literature relating to social isolation and loneliness among older people. We define key terms and identify public health concerns and current interventions.

According to recent figures, around 50% of people over the age of 60 will face social isolation and around 33% will experience some level of loneliness during the remaining period of their lives [[**1**]](#references). These figures point to a growing public health issue affecting older members of the population - one that is likely to continue with the growing size of our ageing society, both in the UK and internationally.

Before going any further, we have to define key terms, specifically loneliness and isolation.

### Defining key terms

Following Valtora and Hanratty, we define loneliness as both a social and emotional phenomenon. According to this definition, social loneliness refers to a "subjective negative feeling associated with a lack of social network", and emotional loneliness refers to the "absence of a specific companion"[[**2**]](#references).

Social isolation, Valtora and Hanratt claim, has multiple dimensions. According to this definition, social isolation refers to a lack of social interactions with friends, family, and the community [[**2**]](#references).

Our target group is adults above the age of 70. However, we acknowledge that individuals who fall short of this boundary would also benefit from the social engagement derived from playing our game. And for our user testing we asked a wide range of users to test our prototype and provide their feedback in our user test survey (see [here](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/UX_Design.md#user-testing) for a discussion about the results of that survey).

### Public health concerns

There are several public health concerns linked to loneliness and isolation. Let's begin by looking at the health issues. The health issues associated with loneliness and isolation range from high blood pressure and suppressed immune function to heart disease, body aches and pains, and insomnia.

The second health concern is mental health issues. These issues often arise when a person is lonely and isolated. Typically, they will experience increased levels of negative emotions such as anxiety and depression. This is a very serious and significant effect and is closely interconnected with health issues since the adverse effects of poor mental health often impact a person's physical health. This is because poor mental health can lead to a lack of motivation to prioritise self-care and a reduced desire to go outside. The former is linked to the above-mentioned health issues and the latter can lead to melatonin suppression which is linked to insomnia.

Overall, the impact of mental health problems is nontrivial. The increased likelihood of depression can lead to suicidal ideation, a weakened immune system due to a bad diet and lack of exercise, as well as health problems such as heart disease and high blood pressure.

The third public health concern is cognitive decline. As with the previous two health concerns, cognitive decline is intimately tied to poor mental and physical health. Without a social network, people can experience a decline in their mental acuity, choosing to avoid activities that challenge their minds and promote cognitive development in late adulthood. Research shows that some cognitive functions such as remembering vocabulary remain during older age, while others such as conceptual reasoning and memory decline. It is very important, therefore, that older adults exercise their minds to avoid cognitive decline [[**3**]](#references).


### Can digital games help tackle the health concerns associated with loneliness and isolation?

Before reviewing existing solutions and identifying the gap in the market concerning digital games for the elderly, we will look at what science tells about the role digital games can play in tackling loneliness and isolation.

According to research by Kaufman et al, digital games offer opportunities for older adults to socialise and engage with each other. This, Kaufman claims, improves their emotional states and reduces depression, as well as having social benefits and improved cognitive performance concerning working memory and attention [[**5**]](#references). This is something they can do without much difficulty. It is also fun, entertaining and provides real value and meaning to their lives.

<div align="center">

</div>

Although the widely held view of ageing is that physical and cognitive decline are inevitable aspects of getting older, recent neuroscience research suggests that these trends can be slowed significantly with the right training and techniques. In particular, playing online games can have significant benefits for the elderly in their daily lives.

Researchers at King's College London have shown that brain training games are very beneficial for older adults, both in terms of cognitive functions such as memory and decision making but also in terms of dealing with everyday tasks such as managing finances, administrative tasks, and shopping [[**6**]](#references). Research has also shown that brain training daily can have long-lasting effects on a person's cognitive abilities.

For instance, Hall et al's (2012) review found that a large majority of studies on the effects of digital gameplay on the elderly demonstrated positive outcomes. Zhang and Kaufman's 2015 review concluded that digital gameplay had positive outcomes in balance, executive function, and processing speed. Furthermore, most research shows that playing games improve life satisfaction and quality of life.

In addition to this, there is research that suggests that maintaining daily mental activity can help delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease.

The level of difficulty of our chosen games is something to bear in mind since research shows that playing more challenging games yields greater benefits than setting the game at a level that is too easy. For instance, Kaufman et al have shown that "playing at an intermediate and advanced level can provide greater benefits than playing at a beginner level since the cognitive demands are greater" [[**4**]](#references). Whilst this indicates that the game difficulty ideally should be challenging, it's worth bearing in mind that the game also has to be enjoyable and fun. So, with that in mind, we would need to carefully decide on a baseline difficulty that would have benefits without the drawbacks associated with a game that is too difficult to even enjoy.

With this in mind, we should encourage our older loved ones to get online. Get them playing games they enjoy — scrabble, chess, sudoku - and show them how fun it can playing online games. The science tells us that not only is it social but it promotes healthy behaviours and keeps your brain active and focused.

Now, let's look at serious play and the motivations behind playing games.


### What is 'serious play' and how can it be used to address loneliness and isolation?

Following Zimmerman (2004), we assign 'play' three categories. The first category refers to 'play' as 'game play', where play is a verb, involving action. In these cases play arises through the interaction with structures and rules. This is what one might typically think of when talking about play. The second category is ludic activity. This refers to instances of play where activities are not only games, but rather unstructured play. It's a simulation of play, and there are no strongly defined objectives. The third category involves play as a mindset. Here, play is more of an adjective where the spirit of play is imbibed into non-typical play activities.

There is a theory of play, developed by Richard Ryan, using the PENS model, the Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction. We have three key needs to satisfy through play. First there is competence, feelings of pride and self-confidence, self-efficacy towards activity and mastery of a challenge. Instil these feelings of pride and self-efficacy, you help push a person reach what they think to be there limits and then go beyond those limits. Autonomy is all about freedom and agency, feeling in control and being able to self-express. Finally, there is relatedness, of connecting with others and feeling like you are a part of community. These are aspects of intrinsic motivations (see R.A.M.P).

A Theory of Fun for Game Design was very useful for practical study of fun in game design.

From our perspective, we decided it was important to address the issues of loneliness and isolation in a fun, playful way. We also decided to create our platform as a game with rules and a simple, visually appealing front-end.


### Rules versus open-endedness

When it came to rules, we felt that it was important to have several important questions to ask ourselves to inform the process of altering our design while keeping play at the centre of our features:

    * Does your system have rules?
    * How does the user learn or discover the rules?
    * How does the user's interaction with the rules make it playful?
    * Does the user get to define the rules? And is it possible to break the rules?
    * How do the rules help the user achieve the objectives?
    * How do the rules relate to the serious problem that our project addresses?

Rules were, we decided an important part of our gameplay experience. Opting for an open-ended approach would have undermined one of the main aspects of our platform, namely to compete against others and challenge yourself. As such, without rules, it would have been difficult to engender competition between players. Along with reducing loneliness, using competition to challenge players cognitively was one of the main aims of our application. The cognitive benefits of playing games are well-understood, as we discuss later in this section.

Now, let's turn to the questions above, and provide our answers to those questions. It was clear that our application should have rules, and that those rules should be straightforward and explained at the beginning of any gameplay. The user's interaction with the rules can be made playful by introducing a point system and leaderboard, and this information could be displayed in a playful way. The user won't be able to define the rules, since that would complicate matters and perhaps confuse the end-users. And breaking the rules will be prohibited since to do so would undermine the spirit of the interaction and the underlying competition to win points and reach the top of the leaderboard. The rules help the users to achieve the objectives by forcing the users to challenge themselves and beat their opponents. This creates a fun interaction.  The rules relate to the serious problem of loneliness and isolation by engaging the users to compete and interact in a way that is fun and playful and, ultimately, serves to mitigate the negative effects of loneliness and isolation.

For our purposes, using Zimmerman's categories, we decided to use play as an activity mediated through structure and rules. So, we use the first category of play. For us, then, play can be found within games, and games can be seen as a subset of play. Serious play is set in the project brief as play and games found within computing. This can involve learning through play (i.e., as an educational tool), which serves to encourage novel solutions and allows 'serious' problems to be arrived at from a fresh angle. When it came to serious play, for our team, it was a good way to apply play in a way to tackle a serious issue without responding in a needlessly uninspired way.

### The psychology behind playing games

To better understand how our end-users will use our game, we now consider the psychological factors underlying a person's desire to play games.

There are a number of important questions to ask. For examples,

 * Does our app have a clear goal?
 * Is this goal apparent up front to the user? or uncovered through use? or never discovered?
 * Does our app raise awareness of a particular issue?
 * Does our app facilitate learning?

Provoking behaviour change, facilitating learning, and promoting wellbeing through socialising are all potential avenues our app could go down.

There are a number of motivations with respect to playing games which we ought to bear in mind when answering the above questions. The two main motivations which we shall consider here are extrinsic and intrinsic motivations. Let's consider these.

#### Extrinsic vs intrinsic motivations

In the context of playing a game, a person is said to have have extrinsic motivations in the form of leaderboards, winning and social contact - external factors which a person interacts with. Intrinsic motivations, by contrast, come from within. That is, intrinsic motivation includes enjoyment, purpose, growth and curiosity. These psychological phenomena arise in the mind and body and have emotional, psychological and cognitive dimensions. How do these two motivations interact and exercise influence over the other?

To see this in action, let's consider gamification. Gamification commonly occurs when extrinsic motivators are applied without providing support for the development of intrinsic motivators. It also occurs when the extrinsic motivators are not valuable enough. Scores and leaderboards, for instance, are extrinsic motivators which visualise game display progress over time. But if these visualisations represent growth and development for a person, and gives them a sense of purpose and true enjoyment then we find that the extrinsic motivation transforms into intrinsic motivation.

So, does there need to be a score for our purposes? Scores support extrinsic factors which can be highly motivating, however they can also be negative for those who aren't doing particularly well. To address this, we could include a collaborative aspect to the memory game with respect to gameplay where players cooperate to complete the game and acquire points to compete against others. This is certainly something we could consider when developing our games, since cooperation can give rise to a strong sense of purpose and enjoyment without the negative consequences of solely competing against another player. A further extension combining cooperation with competition could cultivate a good balance between both styles of game, and ensure that serious play should is present in our product, but with a slight twist.

## Digital literacy

Digital literacy is an important consideration when creating an online application for the elderly, particularly when dealing with the UI and UX design. The reasons for this are simple. Learning to use technologies can help older adults become more included in modern digital society. If they aren't included, they are, by definition, excluded. But learning these technologies can be very hard, especially for older adults. So, it is important to make efforts to ensure that these digital technologies are inclusive, where inclusive means easy to access and understand.

But what exactly is digital literacy? According to Gilster (1997)[[**8**]](#references) digital literacy is the ability to use and understand information from various digital devices. This definition may, of course, be contested. But for our purposes it clearly defines the term, and it serves to inform our design choices with respect to the UI and UX of our platform. Our aim, therefore, is to make using our digital platform simple and accessible so that older adults can learn and improve their level of digital literacy.

Increasing levels of digital literacy among older adults has many obstacles, however. These obstacles extend beyond systematic issues concerning insufficient policies and programs for the elderly. As mentioned in the previous subsection on [digital games tackling loneliness and isolation](#can-digital-games-help-tackle-the-health-concerns-associated-with-loneliness-and-isolation?), older adults tend to have lower memory and self-efficacy. They also require more time to learn new things and understand new materials (Haederle, 2011)[[**9**]](#references). What's more, they are much less experienced with these technologies, having spent a large portion of their lives without these technologies. These challenges - systemic, cognitive, and experience-based - make learning new technologies very difficult for the elderly population, and therefore leads to low up-take of new technologies and devices. Hence, there is a low level of digital literacy among this group.

In light of these considerations, our approach to the UI and UX design will centre around ease of use and a [user-centred design (UCD)](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-centered-design) that emphasises usability. For a discussion of our approach to UX design, see the section on [UX Design](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/UX_Design.md)


## State of the art survey: what is out there already?

We now turn to our state-of-the-art survey. After reviewing the state-of-the-art technologies currently in use, we discovered that digital games have proven to be a very useful tool for helping the older population with social, emotional, and cognitive benefits.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/background11.png)

</div>

We now turn to the state-of-the-art survey. There is a wide range of digital games designed for the elderly and games that can be easily used by the elderly. Mobile games are a good option as you have thousands of fun, free games that allow you to play against friends, family, and anyone in the world.

Puzzle games such as candy crush is a popular mobile game. There are also console games, but for our purposes, we will be focusing on games that you can access through a webpage. Let's focus on the webpage games. We have Bejeweled, which involves swapping bright gems of different shapes and colours to earn points. Gummy Drop! is a game that enables you to rebuild monuments from around the world. AARP's free online games host a huge range of card, puzzle, and arcade games. Gametable's free online games are an example that is close to what we would like to approximate with our application since it has easy games like tic-tac-toe and checkers. It is simple and straightforward to use. Let's now focus on three of these: AARP, Gametable's, and ... after we have done this we will look at two outliers that merit consideration.

### AARP's free online games
___

<div align="center">

</div>

This site contains a very large number of different board games ranging from sudoku and checkers to chess and scrabble.

It has a membership fee of $12 per year

It is fairly straightforward to navigate, however the webpage is quite cluttered.

No video communication functionality.


### The Pros:
- Site contains a wide variety of games
- Responsive
- Clean designed

### The Cons:
- Membership fee is quite high
- Paradox of choice - too many games to choose from
- No video game functionality

### Gametable's free online Games
___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/background4.png)

</div>

This site contains a fewer games that AARP.

It's free

It is a clean, straightforward homepage and is very easy to use.

No video communication functionality.


### The Pros:
- Straightforward to navigate
- It's free
- Fewer games
- Clean design
- Engaging interface


### The Cons:
- No video communication functionality
- Fewer games
- No multiplayer functionality


### Lexulous
___

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/background3.png)

</div>

For example, Lexulous and Words with friends are scrabble-style games easily downloaded from the App store.


### The Pros:
- Straightforward to use
- Multiplayer functionality
- Possible to play with friends and family
- Good for brain training


### The Cons:
- Limited to scrabble-style game
- Is it better than competitors, for e.g., wordswithfriends?
- Requires download which might confuse users



### Outliers

There are a few outliers which host digital games for the elderly.


### A gap in the market

After conducting our state-of-the-art survey, we managed to garner useful data about games for older adults. One of the main insights we arrived at is that there exists a gap in the market. In particular, there is a gap in the market for a site like Gametable which is easy-to-use and with few games to choose from, but with added features of multiplayer mode and video communication functionality. These two features, it is clear, are lacking in current products - there doesn't appear to be anything in the market which offers both of these services.

Pete: Provide examples of the "current solutions out there/trends/relations between what already exists, and what's the gap in the market/research that you're addressing."

According to Pete, we need to outline how our app differs from these apps. We also need to mention a handful of outliers or novel approaches too that may be under the radar, explain how they're important, then perhaps discuss any relevant academic papers (say if there were an interesting machine learning approach.


<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/background6.png)

</div>


## Problem definition

When considering the problem definition, we felt it was important to combat an issue that was both relevant and of real importance. As such, we decided social isolation and loneliness in the elderly would be a good target problem since these are pressing issues in modern times for which there are few available online tools designed to address these issues.

Our problem definition was:

**Ideal**
```
  "There exists a real possibility that digital games can be leveraged to address the societal issues of loneliness and isolation in older adults."
```
**Reality**
```
  "Currently, existing gaming platforms for the elderly are not easy to use and lack video chat functionality."
```
**Consequences**
```
  "There is an insufficient range of digital games for the elderly, which presents an untapped resource for tackling loneliness and isolation."
```
**Proposal**
```
  "To address this gap in the market, we propose NotSoBored Games, a simple online board game experience, with a user-oriented design and fun video chat functionality to reconnect friends and loved ones suffering from the effects of loneliness and isolation."
```

Social isolation and loneliness in the elderly and insufficient online tools to help address these issues. Our proposed solution to this problem was to connect the elderly through an online multiplayer game designed to reduce feelings of loneliness and improve health and wellbeing.

Clearly, the problem of social isolation and loneliness in the elderly is a huge issue facing humanity. A growing elderly population with increased needs in later life present a serious health care crisis. The scope and challenge of this problem, clearly, go beyond the scope of our project. In light of this, our scope is narrowed to make a real, meaningful impact on the lives of our target population.

## Motivation

The motivation behind our webpage is to create a SPA capable of combating the real-world problem of loneliness and isolation through a multiplayer online board game. Our motivation for creating this application is simple. We can see that we live in an ageing society with inadequate social care infrastructure, and we know from personal experience that older adults are particularly vulnerable to loneliness and isolation. Digital games are abundant, but there is a shortage of digital games designed for the elderly. Our motivation is to address this gap in the market, and try to leverage a digital game platform to try and mitigate loneliness and isolation. This is important as ageing societies continue to grow and the social infrastructure in place are unable to adequately support older adults.
