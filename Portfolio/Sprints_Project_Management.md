# 4. Sprints & Project Management

In this section, we discuss project sprints and management. We start by going over the team organisation, roles, and contributions. We then move on to discuss the way we approached communication and documentation of sprints. Finally, we discuss the team use of git and the impact Covid-19 had on our working practices.

## Group working methods

With regard to the group working methods, we knew it was very important to maintain regular contact with one another throughout the duration of the unit. Given that we were working remotely, communication was obviously essential. For a discussion on our chosen form of communication, see [Communication](#communication).

We also realised the importance of delegation. So, to ensure that the team was organised with a clear, delegated structure in mind we assigned team roles. For a discussion of this, see [Team Organisation](#team-ogranisation) and [Team roles and contributions](#team-roles-and-contributions).

## Team Organisation

Each of our team members had a unique set of skills that they were able to bring to the project, with different strengths and perspectives. Given this, we decided to assign roles to team members according to where they thought their strengths lay in software engineering.

Every team member participated in discussions concerning system design and implementation to ensure that we were in agreement on the goal and scope of the project. This meant that everyone in the group was continually up-to-date on the changes and developments of the application, and there were no unsaid grievances about actions or decisions that were being taken. We were open, honest and respectful towards one another throughout the build period. As such, we maintained good group cohesion.


## Team roles and contributions

We assigned team member roles through an open conversation on Microsoft Teams. In what follows, we give a quick breakdown of the individual roles of each team member and the reasons for those role assignments.

Given Lizhao's strengths in coding, she naturally wanted to be involved in both the front and backend of the build. Her clear, logical approach to all aspects of the build meant that she was an invaluable team member who could always be relied on.

Harri took on the leadership role as the project manager whilst also getting involved in the coding and the design side of things. His strong leadership and steady hand meant that he was more than capable of steering us through every stage of the project, from ideation to implementation.

Like Lizhao, Chris's strengths lie in coding, but with a particular focus on the BackEnd. Given his skills in this department, he was happy to devote the majority of his time to the build and maintenance of the database and servers. He also offered great insights on every aspect of the build. As with the other team members, he was invaluable throughout.

Max, who likes design, dedicated most of his time to the FrontEnd. He got involved with the BackEnd too, but was mostly keen to develop his FrontEnd skills.

## Communication

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown, our team was unable to meet in person to discuss the system design, implementation and write code together. Therefore, it was essential that we kept in regular contact with each other. We did this via the communication platform, Microsoft Teams, which we felt was an excellent platform for hosting meetings.

The reasons for this are as follows. First, by the beginning of TB2 we were all very familiar with the platform, since it had formed the basis of nearly all our taught modules on the MSc. Second, we decided that given its messaging and video conferencing functionality we could easily move between typed messages and face-to-face discussions. The former were very useful throughout the day, as a way of sharing thoughts, ideas and developments concerning the project. The latter enabled us to simulate the type of face-to-face conversation that we would have in the lab were in not for the national lockdown.

Given this, we were able to work collaboratively whilst living in different parts of the country. And with regard to the frequency of our meetings, we decided it would be reasonable to initially meet three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays but with flexibility to increase that frequency in the later stages of the module if that was deemed necessary.

## Documentation of sprints

When it came to documenting our project sprints, we decided. As such, we...

## The Impact of COVID-19

The outbreak of COVID-19 in March, and the subsequent lockdowns running up to the end of April affected each us in many ways. The first issue Covid-19 brought was that it prevented us from meeting in person. This meant that we were reliant on communication platforms to not only talk about the project but work collaboratively on the coding side of things. The second issue we faced was...
