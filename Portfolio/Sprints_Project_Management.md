# 4. Sprints & Project Management

In this section, we discuss project sprints and management. We start by going over the team organisation, roles, and contributions. We then move on to discuss the way we approached communication and documentation of sprints. Finally, we discuss the team use of git and the impact Covid-19 had on our working practices.

## Group working methods

With regard to the group working methods, we knew it was very important to maintain regular contact with one another throughout the duration of the unit. Given that we were working remotely, communication was obviously essential. For a discussion on our chosen form of communication, see [Communication](#communication).

We also realised the importance of delegation. So, to ensure that the team was organised with a clear, delegated structure in mind we assigned team roles. For a discussion of this, see [Team Organisation](#team-ogranisation) and [Team roles and contributions](#team-roles-and-contributions).

## Software development lifecycle

In order to produce working software, it is important to follow a recognised methodology. The methodology helps guide collaborative decision making from project initiation to production use by end-users. There exist two main methodologies for this purpose: the waterfall model and the Agile method. These methods cover the planning, design, coding, testing and production involved in software development. Both have their merits and drawbacks. We'll now take a look at these approaches.

### The waterfall method

First, we'll look the waterfall method. The lifecycle of this approach is depicted below:

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints2.png)

</div>

The main focus of this approach is structure. Milestones are set, breaking the project into manageable chunks. These chunks represent phases which are connected in a linear sequence, where each phase in the sequence requires certain deliverables to initiate the next phase. This creates a waterfall-style process of development.

### The Pros:
- Consists of clear defined stages
- Phases completed in a linear process, one after the other
- Straightforward to manage
- The lifecycle is well documented and easy to follow

### The Cons:
- Inflexible to changing requirements
- Excludes the client
- Working software not produced until late in the lifecycle
- Hard to identify and measure progress within each stage
- Testing occurs near the end of the lifecycle

### The Agile methods

Now, let's take a look at the Agile methodology. The lifecyle of this approach is depicted below:

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints1.png)

</div>

The main feature of this model is that software development is broken down into incremental cycles.

This method is flexible throughout the build. It is flexible with respect to the stakeholders, which means that the product is more tailored to their needs. There are no rigid rules with the Agile system development lifecycle. it can be changed and altered as required by your project or organisation. Given the flexibility of this method, one of the most important aspects of the method is communication, since the wants and desires of the stakeholders may change during the initial planning and the iterations of the lifecyle.

There are several different frameworks used to implement the Agile method: Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Software Development (DSDM) and Crystal Methodologies.

### The Pros:
- Client-focused approach
- Flexibility allows changes to occur at any stage
- Working software delivered quickly
- Allows for improvement of features designed earlier in the lifecyle

### The Cons
- Easy to lose focus if the client is unclear on their requirements
- Insufficient attention given to design and necessary documentation
- Lacks predictability
- Greater time and commitment
- No finite end to the project


### Agile - Our chosen methodology

In light of the strengths and weaknesses of both methodologies, we decided to use the Agile approach for our project development.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints3.png)

</div>

The format of our software development was as follows. Our build was broken down into sprints. Each sprint centres around a particular set of features, tests to test the robustness those features, and making sure that our users' expectations and demands are met through the creation of those added features.

Following standard practice, we broke the sprints into two week cycles. During each cycle we created a backlog of tasks and user feedback. We used the feedback from previous sprints to help inform the project development. We then reviewed our progress during our weekly meetings. During these reviews we conducted integration testing and assurance testing. Following this, we then aimed to  merge all changes to the master branch of Github.

Our sprints really got under way in March. These continued until early May. The sprints centred around a feature implementation required for that week as well as any tasks in the backlog from previous weeks.

The goals for the week were decided and we kept to those goals until the end of the week. We reviewed our work at the end of each sprint. This meant that our approach towards the development of the product was consistent with the agile methodology.

The requirements acted to inform our tests. This meant that our systems were able to integrate properly at the end of each sprint.

Given the fact that we had very little time to build the product, we felt that it was important to deploy a working application as soon as we possibly could.

With respect to the meetings and sprints and how they worked, we met every Monday at 11am. And then on Wednesdays and Fridays. In every successive meeting we discussed the work we had done, and when items were assigned tasks as "complete". We compiled a list of Backlog and items that were complete.

At the heart of this process was the users. So, during every sprint we had the users in mind, making sure to address their goals and demands.

### Jira

We used Jira to implement these actions, and created Gantt charts to visualise the progress of tasks. Jira helped structure the timetable so it was clear what was being done by who and where in the lifecycle it sat.

### Product backlog

Within Jira there is a Backlog. This is a product backlog which contains list of the main deliverables we intended to implement during each sprint. These deliverables, or items, are prioritised to ensure that the most important features are completed before less important ones. These items were carried forward to subsequent sprints were we unable to complete them within the intended sprint. This served as an essential part of our product development, since it helped our decision making with regard to task assignment and prioritisation.

The presence of an item in the backlog guarantees that the item is being worked on. However, it does not ensure that the item will be completed before the end of the sprint, or at all. In some circumstances, backlog items will not be completed due to practical issues.

In the following, we give a detailed account of each sprint, the actions which arose from it and how our two users "Bob" and "Simon" felt about the new features.


## Team Organisation

Each of our team members had a unique set of skills that they were able to bring to the project, with different strengths and perspectives. Given this, we decided to assign roles to team members according to where they thought their strengths lay in software engineering.

Every team member participated in discussions concerning system design and implementation to ensure that we were in agreement on the goal and scope of the project. This meant that everyone in the group was continually up-to-date on the changes and developments of the application, and there were no unsaid grievances about actions or decisions that were being taken. We were open, honest and respectful towards one another throughout the build period. As such, we maintained good group cohesion.


## Team roles and contributions

We assigned team member roles through an open conversation on Microsoft Teams. In what follows, we give a quick breakdown of the individual roles of each team member and the reasons for those role assignments.

Given Lizhao's strengths in coding, she naturally wanted to be involved in both the front and backend of the build. Her clear, logical approach to all aspects of the build meant that she was an invaluable team member who could always be relied on.

Harri took on the leadership role as the project manager whilst also getting involved in the coding and the design side of things. His strong leadership and steady hand meant that he was more than capable of steering us through every stage of the project, from ideation to implementation.

Like Lizhao, Chris's strengths lie in coding, but with a particular focus on the BackEnd. Given his skills in this department, he was happy to devote the majority of his time to the build and maintenance of the database and servers. He also offered great insights on every aspect of the build. As with the other team members, he was invaluable throughout.

Max, who likes design, dedicated most of his time to the FrontEnd. He got involved with the BackEnd too, but was mostly keen to develop his FrontEnd skills.

## Communication

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown, our team was unable to meet in person to discuss the system design, implementation and write code together. Therefore, it was essential that we kept in regular contact with each other. We did this via the communication platform, Microsoft Teams, which we felt was an excellent platform for hosting meetings.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/comms1.png)

</div>

We also created a discord server. This, too, was an excellent platform for quick-time communication.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/comms2.png)

</div>

The reasons for this are as follows. First, by the beginning of TB2 we were all very familiar with the platform, since it had formed the basis of nearly all our taught modules on the MSc. Second, we decided that given its messaging and video conferencing functionality we could easily move between typed messages and face-to-face discussions. The former were very useful throughout the day, as a way of sharing thoughts, ideas and developments concerning the project. The latter enabled us to simulate the type of face-to-face conversation that we would have in the lab were in not for the national lockdown.

Given this, we were able to work collaboratively whilst living in different parts of the country. And with regard to the frequency of our meetings, we decided it would be reasonable to initially meet three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays but with flexibility to increase that frequency in the later stages of the module if that was deemed necessary.


## Documentation of sprints

The sprints are in chronological order, starting with the first sprint in late February all the way up to the final sprint in May.

We will be referring to the meeting notes, the product backlog (that is, the list of key features to be implemented), and the user feedback.

This will be broken down into four parts:
 1. Main goals/aims of the sprint
 2. Key points from the meeting
 3. Backlog items
 4. Feedback from users

## Sprint 1 - Ideation and Setup (01.03.21 - 08.03.21)
___


The aim of this sprint was to decide on our architecture and how we intended to progress with regard to communication. It also involved the ideation phase where we agreed upon the concept and design of our product. One of the first things we did was get setup on Github, and tried to develop our understanding the basic operations of GitHub, the importance of creating different branches and adhering to a GitHub protocol with respect to push and pull request (for a discussion on our approach to GitHub, see [**Team use of Git**](team-use-of-git)). We agreed upon the channels of communication we would use, namely Microsoft Teams and Discord. We decided on multiplayer board games for the elderly with a video feed. We also decided to call the product 'NotSoBored Games'. And, in addition, we began by adding to the readme in our repository.

   * We made the group decision to use the MEAN stack.
   * Create a group Discord server
   * Set up GitHub repository and familiarised ourselves with the platform.
   * Agreed to setup a protocol with regard to GitHub.
   * Create a simple paper prototype of the UI design.

### Relevant backlog items

The following are a list of tasks and features that the team were tasked to deliver by the end of the sprint.

    ```
      → Backlog item: setup GitHub repository
      → Backlog item: create a GitHub protocol and familiarise ourselves with it
      → Backlog item: create a simple UI design paper prototype
      → Backlog item: create a group Discord server
      → Backlog item: create stakeholder stories

    ```

### Evaluation of Sprint

This was our first sprint. The main goal of this sprint was to establish a communication and GitHub protocol. This was important, we felt, because once our channels of communication were setup we could then work efficiently and effectively. It was particularly important to make sure every team member had a good working understanding of how to use GitHub. On reflection, we should have dedicated more time to doing this. In particular, we would have benefited from one team member becoming the GitHub expert who could then go on to teach other team members how to use the platform. We should have also made sure that the GitHub protocol was fully understood by everyone and that we had an idea of how we would work together to push our progress to the repository. We could have also benefited from getting different branches setup on our GitHub repository.

Another area we could have improved on was the approach taken to the Agile methodology. Specifically, we should have taken time to learn the methodology and be able to draw out a rough timeline for our development lifecycle. This would have given us structure and reassurance that we were tackling the tasks at hand in the correct way. That said, we still defined our weekly goals and had established several lines of communication which all served to keep every team member up-to-date on group progress.

After deciding we would use the MEAN stack, we thought it would be sensible to get user feedback. However, we discovered that there wasn't much we could ask our user's since we were in a very early stage.


## Sprint 2 - Build game frontend and design backend (08.03.21 - 15.03.21)
___

The aim of this sprint was to get something built and pushed onto GitHub. We decided to build four games and assigned two of those games to different team members. We also discussed how our stakeholder stories and agreed that their feedback would inform the development lifecycle. We had created four stakeholders all of whom would, when appropriate, give feedback on newly implemented features. This was, we felt, a sensible approach since it meant that we'd be putting the needs of the stakeholders first, which would ensure that the product would be something the end-users and other stakeholders would like and enjoy using. During this sprint, we agreed that we should build something for the end-users as a number one priority. As such, by the end of this sprint we want to have something to show our end-users, to find establish any problems or issues they might have we the product and closely follow the agile methodology.

### Key points

  * Games allocated to team members
  * Chris updated on progress of Connect 4 game.
  * Browsed previously completed group projects together and took notes.
  * Discussed stakeholder stories and their feedback.
  * Start documentation early, creating sections and subsections according to report instructions.


### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * GitHub protocol established
   * User stories created
   * Lizhao presented the paper prototype video she has been creating.
   * Chris updated on progress of the Java produced Connect 4 game.
   * Browsed previously completed group projects together.

### Relevant backlog items

 ```
   → Backlog item: design and build start page
   → Backlog item: add audio to start page
   → Backlog item: start building games
   → Backlog item: design backend

 ```

Given the client-led approach of the Agile method, we now turn to user feedback. Please note that these are fictional users whose feedback is based on real user feedback we acquired through our user testing. To see our user testing, please see: [Evaluation](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Evaluation.md).

I am aware, however, that you haven't built anything yet. This is something you need to prioritise, since the whole purpose of sprints is to produce something tangible which your end-users can properly engage with. This will ensure that you are always implementing the agile methodology, and it will ensure that the product is on the right track with respect to the wants and needs of the end user. It is also good that you have started on the frontend, since you want to build a minimal viable product as soon as you can.</td>

</tr>
</tr>
</table>

### Evaluation of Sprint

During this sprint, our focus was to get started on the frontend. This was because we wanted to have something to show our users as earlier as possible to obtain feedback and make changes and modifications based on their responses. The backlog of items implemented from the previous sprint, such as creating stakeholder stories and creating a paper prototype were crucial to make sure that we were adopting the agile framework, putting the end-user first and changing and refining the product according to their feedback.



## Sprint 3 - Deploy the product (15.03.21 - 22.03.21)
___

The aim of this sprint was to have something to show our stakeholders and obtain feedback.

### Key points

   * We made the group decision to use the MEAN stack.
   * Decided to create a multiplayer game with video feed.
   * Set up GitHub repository and familiarised ourselves with the platform.

### Evaluation of Sprint

We felt we were able to do a lot of work during this sprint. Having a start-page to show the users and collect feedback was invaluable at this stage of the development. However, we were able to produce a minimum viable product, which on reflection we would have liked to have done by this stage of the development lifecycle.

## Sprints paused - other work commitments/no new tasks (22.03.21 - 05.03.21)

By this stage, we felt it was appropriate to pause the sprints. The rationale for this decision was twofold. First, we had a large database assignment due in for the Java unit, which took up a lot of our time. Second, there were a number of unfinished backlog items from the previous sprints which needed to be attended to before proceeding to the next sprint. These two reasons, taken together, were, we felt, sufficient to warrant pausing the sprints and focusing on both of these things before moving on to the next sprint.

## Sprint 4 - User testing (05.03.21 - 12.04.21)
___


The aim of this sprint was to make sure our application, including the video chat and friend invite functionality, was working properly and fit for pre-release. In order to ensure it was we had to conduct rigorous testing.

### Key points

   * Test video chat
   * Conduct rigorous Testing
   * Debugging
   * Add component to add friends

  → Backlog item: test video chat
  → Backlog item: testing

### Evaluation of Sprint



## Team use of GitHub

At the centre of this whole project was GitHub. It was an indispensable platform which we used to great effect. Given the importance of this platform, we knew that it was very important that we used the platform in a structured and rational way. As such, we decided to draw up some guidelines on how to use GitHub. Going forward, this was essential since it meant that we were able to push progress onto the repository where everyone could access it and commit further changes.

We created a number of branches. First, there was our main branch. This was were our finalised documentation and code would sit. We periodically merged this branch with our development, or 'dev' branch.  

1. Create dev branch
2. Create game branches
3. Create database branch
4. Create multiplayer branch
