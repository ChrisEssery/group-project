# 4. Sprints & Project Management

In this section, we discuss project sprints and management. We start by going over the team organisation, roles, and contributions. We then move on to discuss the way we approached communication and documentation of sprints. Finally, we discuss the team use of git and the impact Covid-19 had on our working practices.

## Group working methods

With regard to the group working methods, we knew it was very important to maintain regular contact with one another throughout the duration of the unit. Given that we were working remotely, communication was obviously essential. For a discussion on our chosen form of communication, see [Communication](#communication).

We also realised the importance of delegation. So, to ensure that the team was organised with a clear, delegated structure in mind we assigned team roles. For a discussion of this, see [Team Organisation](#team-ogranisation) and [Team roles and contributions](#team-roles-and-contributions).

## Software development lifecycle

In order to produce working software, it is important to follow a recognised methodology. The methodology helps guide collaborative decision making from project initiation to production use by end-users. There exist two main methodologies for this purpose: the waterfall model and the Agile method. These methods cover the planning, design, coding, testing and production involved in software development. Both have their merits and drawbacks. We'll now take a look at these approaches.

### The waterfall method

First, we'll look the waterfall method. The lifecycle of this approach is depicted below:

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints2.png)

</div>

The main focus of this approach is structure. Milestones are set, breaking the project into manageable chunks. These chunks represent phases which are connected in a linear sequence, where each phase in the sequence requires certain deliverables to initiate the next phase. This creates a waterfall-style process of development.

### The Pros:
- Consists of clear defined stages
- Phases completed in a linear process, one after the other
- Straightforward to manage
- The lifecycle is well documented and easy to follow

### The Cons:
- Inflexible to changing requirements
- Excludes the client
- Working software not produced until late in the lifecycle
- Hard to identify and measure progress within each stage
- Testing occurs near the end of the lifecycle

### The Agile methods

Now, let's take a look at the Agile methodology. The lifecyle of this approach is depicted below:

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints1.png)

</div>

The main feature of this model is that software development is broken down into incremental cycles.

This method is flexible throughout the build. It is flexible with respect to the stakeholders, which means that the product is more tailored to their needs. There are no rigid rules with the Agile system development lifecycle. it can be changed and altered as required by your project or organisation. Given the flexibility of this method, one of the most important aspects of the method is communication, since the wants and desires of the stakeholders may change during the initial planning and the iterations of the lifecyle.

There are several different frameworks used to implement the Agile method: Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Software Development (DSDM) and Crystal Methodologies.

### The Pros:
- Client-focused approach
- Flexibility allows changes to occur at any stage
- Working software delivered quickly
- Allows for improvement of features designed earlier in the lifecycle

### The Cons
- Easy to lose focus if the client is unclear on their requirements
- Insufficient attention given to design and necessary documentation
- Lacks predictability
- Greater time and commitment
- No finite end to the project


### Agile - Our chosen methodology

In light of the strengths and weaknesses of both methodologies, we decided to use the Agile approach for our project development.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/sprints3.png)

</div>

The format of our software development was as follows. Our build was broken down into sprints. Each sprint centres around a particular set of features, tests to test the robustness those features, and making sure that our users' expectations and demands are met through the creation of those added features.

Following standard practice - as well as advice from the teaching staff - we broke the sprints into weekly cycles. During each cycle we created a backlog of tasks/features and user stories. We used the user stories in each sprint from previous sprints to help inform the project development. We then reviewed our progress during our weekly meetings. During these reviews we conducted integration testing and assurance testing. Following this, we then aimed to  merge all changes to the main branch of Github. This did not always happen, however, as some new features took longer than others to build and implement.

Our sprints really got under way in the beginning of March. These continued until early May. The sprints centred around feature implementations required for that week as well as any tasks in the backlog from previous sprints. The goals for the week were decided and we kept to those goals until the end of the week. We reviewed our work at the end of each sprint. This meant that our approach towards the development of the product was consistent with the agile methodology.

Given the fact that we had very little time to build the product, we felt that it was important to deploy a working application as soon as we possibly could.

With respect to the meetings and sprints and how they worked, we met every Monday at 11am. And then on Wednesdays and Fridays. In every successive meeting we discussed the work we had done, and when items were assigned tasks as "complete". We compiled a list of Backlog and items that were complete. Overall, though, at the heart of this process was the users. During every sprint we had the users in mind, ensuring that we addressed their goals and demands.

### Scrums

We used the Scrum framework to apply Agile working practice. This entailed one team member acted as the 'Scrum master'. The scrum master was responsible for dictating the timelines on Github and making sure that everything was on track. This meant that we had a clear agreement amongst our team as to when our main deliverables for the week were expected by, as well as offering guidance on which user stories were being used for that week.

### Jira

We used Jira to implement these actions, and created Gantt charts to visualise the progress of tasks. Jira helped structure the timetable so it was clear what was being done by who and where in the lifecycle it sat.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/jira.png)

</div>

### Product backlog

Within Jira there is a Backlog. This is a product backlog which contains list of the main deliverables we intended to implement during each sprint. These deliverables, or items, are prioritised to ensure that the most important features are completed before less important ones. These items were carried forward to subsequent sprints were we unable to complete them within the intended sprint. This served as an essential part of our product development, since it helped our decision making with regard to task assignment and prioritisation.

The presence of an item in the backlog guarantees that the item is being worked on. However, it does not ensure that the item will be completed before the end of the sprint, or at all. In some circumstances, backlog items will not be completed due to practical issues.

In the following, we give a detailed account of each sprint, the actions which arose from it and how our two users "Bob" and "Simon" felt about the new features.


## Team Organisation

Each of our team members had a unique set of skills that they were able to bring to the project, with different strengths and perspectives. Given this, we decided to assign roles to team members according to where they thought their strengths lay in software engineering.

Every team member participated in discussions concerning system design and implementation to ensure that we were in agreement on the goal and scope of the project. This meant that everyone in the group was continually up-to-date on the changes and developments of the application, and there were no unsaid grievances about actions or decisions that were being taken. We were open, honest and respectful towards one another throughout the build period. As such, we maintained good group cohesion.


## Team roles and contributions

We assigned team member roles through an open conversation on Microsoft Teams. In what follows, we give a quick breakdown of the individual roles of each team member and the reasons for those role assignments.

Given Lizhao's strengths in coding, she naturally wanted to be involved in both the front and backend of the build. Her clear, logical approach to all aspects of the build meant that she was an invaluable team member who could always be relied on.

Harri took on the leadership role as the project manager whilst also getting involved in the coding and the design side of things. His strong leadership and steady hand meant that he was more than capable of steering us through every stage of the project, from ideation to implementation.

Like Lizhao, Chris's strengths lie in coding, but with a particular focus on the BackEnd. Given his skills in this department, he was happy to devote the majority of his time to the build and maintenance of the database and servers. He also offered great insights on every aspect of the build. As with the other team members, he was invaluable throughout.

Max, who likes design, dedicated most of his time to the FrontEnd. He got involved with the BackEnd too, but was mostly keen to develop his FrontEnd skills.

## Communication

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic and national lockdown, our team was unable to meet in person to discuss the system design and implementation. We were also unable to sit down and write code together. Given these constraints, it was essential that we kept in regular contact with one another. We did this via two communication platforms. The first platform we used was Microsoft Teams, which we felt was an excellent platform for hosting meetings.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/comms1.png)

</div>

The reasons why we chose this platform are as follows. First, by the beginning of TB2 we were all very familiar with the platform, since it had formed the basis of all our taught modules on the MSc. Second, we decided that given its messaging and video conferencing functionality we could easily move between typed messages and face-to-face discussions. The former were very useful throughout the day, as a way of sharing thoughts, ideas and developments concerning the project. The latter enabled us to simulate the type of face-to-face conversation that we would have had in the lab were in not for the national lockdown.

The second communication platform we used was Discord, the instant messaging group-chat platform designed for groups and communities. As with Microsoft Teams, we were familiar with Discord since we had been using it throughout TB1. This, too, was an excellent platform for instant messaging and quick-time communication.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/comms2.png)

</div>

Because we were familiar with both of these applications, we were able to seamlessly communicate without any user error, and we were able to work collaboratively whilst living in different parts of the country which was essential given the Covid-19 crisis and national lockdown. In terms of the frequency of our meetings, we decided it would be reasonable to initially meet three times a week on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, but with the flexibility to increase that frequency in the later stages of the module when we began weekly sprints.


## Documentation of sprints

The sprints are in chronological order, starting with the first sprint in late February all the way up to the final sprint in May.

ADD GANTT CHART

We will be referring to the meeting notes, the product backlog (that is, the list of key features to be implemented), and the user feedback.

This will be broken down into four parts:
 1. Main goals/aims of the sprint
 2. Key points from the meeting
 3. Backlog items
 4. Feedback from users

 Each of the items in the backlog is tagged with 'finished' and 'unfinished' -> add something about this.

## Sprint 1 : Ideation and Setup (01.03.21-08.03.21)
___


The aim of this sprint was to decide on our architecture and how we intended to progress with regard to communication. It also involved the ideation phase where we agreed upon the concept and design of our product. One of the first things we did was get setup on Github, and tried to develop our understanding the basic operations of GitHub, the importance of creating different branches and adhering to a GitHub protocol with respect to push and pull request (for a discussion on our approach to GitHub, see [**Team use of GitHub**](#team-use-of-github)). We agreed upon the channels of communication we would use, namely Microsoft Teams and Discord. We decided on multiplayer board games for the elderly with a video feed. We also decided to call the product 'NotSoBored Games'. And, in addition, we began by adding to the readme in our repository.

   * We made the group decision to use the MEAN stack.
   * Create a group Discord server
   * Set up GitHub repository and familiarised ourselves with the platform.
   * Agreed to setup a protocol with regard to GitHub.
   * Create a simple paper prototype of the UI design.

### Backlog items

The following are a list of tasks and features that the team were tasked to deliver by the end of the sprint.

    ```
      → Backlog item: setup GitHub repository
      → Backlog item: create a GitHub protocol and familiarise ourselves with it
      → Backlog item: create a simple UI design paper prototype
      → Backlog item: create a group Discord server
      → Backlog item: create stakeholder stories

    ```

### Evaluation of Sprint

This was our first sprint. The main goal of this sprint was to establish a communication and GitHub protocol. This was important, we felt, because once our channels of communication were setup we could then work efficiently and effectively. It was particularly important to make sure every team member had a good working understanding of how to use GitHub. On reflection, we should have dedicated more time to doing this. In particular, we would have benefited from one team member becoming the GitHub expert who could then go on to teach other team members how to use the platform. We should have also made sure that the GitHub protocol was discussed in more depth so we all understood how to properly utilise the branch-based workflow.

After deciding we would use the MEAN stack, we thought it would be sensible to get user feedback. However, we discovered that there wasn't anything we could ask our users because we had nothing to show them before the end of this first sprint.


## Sprint 2 : Start building front-end and design back-end (08.03.21-15.03.21)
___

The aim of this sprint was to get something built and pushed onto GitHub. We decided to build four games and assigned two of those games to different team members. We also discussed how our stakeholder stories and agreed that their feedback would inform the development lifecycle. We had created four stakeholders all of whom would, when appropriate, give feedback on newly implemented features. This was, we felt, a sensible approach since it meant that we'd be putting the needs of the stakeholders first, which would ensure that the product would be something the end-users and other stakeholders would like and enjoy using. During this sprint, we agreed that we should build something for the end-users as a number one priority. As such, by the end of this sprint we want to have something to show our end-users, to find any problems or issues they might encounter when using the product and thereby follow the agile methodology.

### Key points

  * Games allocated to team members
  * Browsed previously completed group projects together and took notes.
  * Discussed stakeholder stories and their feedback.
  * Work on documentation with a focus on background research and state-of-the-art survey.


### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * GitHub protocol established
   * User stories created
   * Paper prototype and paper prototype video shown to users.
   * Update given on progress of games.
   * Browsed previously completed group projects together.

### New backlog items

 ```
   → Backlog item: design and build start page
   → Backlog item: add audio to start page
   → Backlog item: start building games
   → Backlog item: design backend
   → Backlog item: conduct background research and state-of-the-art survey

 ```

Given the client-led approach of the Agile method, we now turn to user feedback. Please note that these are fictional users whose feedback is based on real user feedback we acquired through our user testing. To see our user testing, please see: [Evaluation](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Evaluation.md).

I don't entirely understand what this means. Could you perhaps add some instructions? </td>

<td>Create stakeholder stories</td>
<td>I think it's a really good step to start communicate with your end-users from the very start of the project development, which you've done through creating user stories. The paper prototype video is also a very good idea, so well done with that. I am aware, however, that you haven't built anything yet. This is something you need to prioritise, since the whole purpose of sprints is to produce something tangible which your end-users can properly engage with. This will ensure that you are always implementing the agile methodology, and it will ensure that the product is on the right track with respect to the wants and needs of the end user. It is also good that you have started on the frontend, since you want to build a minimum viable product as soon as you can.</td>

</tr>
</tr>
</table>

### Evaluation of Sprint

During this sprint, our focus was to get started on the front-end of the MEAN stack. This was because we wanted to have something to show our users as earlier as possible to obtain feedback which we could then use to influence changes and refinements of the product design. The backlog of items implemented from the previous sprint, such as creating stakeholder stories and a paper prototype were crucial to make sure that we were adopting the agile framework, putting the end-user first and adapting the product according to their feedback. We felt that this should always be at the forefront of all sprints, and we recognised that our product manager and sponsor proto-personas would as help inform our design and development process.

At this stage we would have benefited from focusing on producing a minimum viable product (MVP) as soon as reasonably possible. Whilst we were aware of the importance of this, we didn't agree on a particular point in the development lifecycle to deploy our MVP. On reflection, this would have been sensible because then we could have prioritised the deployment of a MVP which could then be modified and improved upon.



## Sprint 3 : Obtain user feedback and continue building front-end (15.03.21-22.03.21)
___

The aim of this sprint was to show the stakeholders our start page and obtain their feedback. By this point, the backlog items of building a start page and adding audio to the start page had been implemented by the end of the previous sprint. This gave us a great opportunity to show our stakeholders the style, structure and layout of the first page, which would in turn inform our understanding of the UI and UX. Having this knowledge would then give us an understanding of how to approach the remaining pages of the SPA. Further to this, we started this sprint with new insights we'd acquired from our state of the art survey, which gave us a better understanding of similar online gaming platforms and any gaps in the market. We discovered that, to the best of our knowledge, there were no online games for the elderly which had video chat and a very simple, intuitive layout. This encouraged us to pursue adding a video chat feature to our games, and cemented our belief that the UI should be as straightforward as possible.

For this sprint, we prioritised the creation of a UI wireframe and obtaining feedback from our stakeholders and other potential users including older family members. To do this, we decided to create a questionnaire. We also agreed it was important to get working versions of the games in front of the users as soon as possible, and to continue with documentation but with a focus on sprints and project management.

### Key points

   * Obtain feedback from users regarding the start page.
   * Create UI wireframe and obtain user feedback.
   * Create and circulate questionnaire regarding UI wireframe.
   * Start building back-end.
   * Build basic versions of games and obtain user feedback.
   * Create a user login.
   * Continue with documentation with a focus on Sprints and project management.


### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * Build start page.
   * Add audio to start page.
   * Memory game and connect four build underway.
   * Backend design started.
   * Documentation underway with a focus on background research and UX design.


### New backlog items

```
  → Backlog item: Continue researching video chat APIs
  → Backlog item: Obtain user feedback on UI wireframe through a questionnaire
  → Backlog item: Create login
  → Backlog item: Build basic version of games and obtain feedback

```

<td>This start page is really good, well done. I think the style and format is appropriate for your end-users, however I would stress that it is really important to gather user feedback as often as possible to ascertain what they think about the front-end design of the product. One thing you might want to consider is adding simple instructions for the login and entering the games. This is because it might be hard for them to navigate. It's important to remember that your end-users will more than likely have a low level of digital literacy, so you want to make your product very easy to use. For this reason, I would advise that your scrum leader makes sure that you are always revisiting the issue of usability and making sure the end-users are consulted on new features throughout the development lifecycle. </td>

### Evaluation of Sprint

We felt we were able to do a lot of work during this sprint. Having a start-page to show the users and collect feedback was invaluable at this stage of the development. However, we weren't able to produce a MVP, which on reflection we would have liked to have done by this stage of the development lifecycle. Regardless, we were happy with a progress by this point in time. The designs for the backend were coming along nicely and it seemed that we would be able to integrate the front and back-end fairly easily.

It was clear, however, that our workload in the other units of term was getting bigger, and as such our progress might slow down over the coming weeks. We also wanted to better understand how we would build the database and API. This would take time and was likely to be a backlog item which carried through to subsequent sprints.


## Sprints paused : complete backlog items and other work commitments (22.03.21-05.04.21)
___

By this stage, we felt it was appropriate to pause the sprints. The rationale for this decision was twofold. First, we had a large database assignment due in for the Java unit, which took up a lot of our time. Second, there were a number of unfinished backlog items from the previous sprints which needed to be attended to before proceeding to the next sprint. These reasons, we felt, were sufficient to warrant pausing the sprints before continuing onto the next one. The pause was a decision we took based on the situation we found ourselves in. It not only demonstrates the flexible nature of the agile methodology, but importantly, highlights that we understood it was important to complete uncompleted items.

Another important aspect of this 'pause' was that it enabled us to get stuck into the documentation. From early on, we realised the importance of working on the documentation continuously. This not only helped keep a record of what we had done, but also, helped focus our attention on where we were heading and what we needed to do.


## Sprint 4 : Add multiplayer functionality, video chat and build backend (05.04.21-12.04.21)
___


This was the first sprint after pausing our sprints for two weeks. By this point we had completed a lot of the backlog items, and had made a lot of progress both with the system implementation and the documentation. The aim of this sprint was to make sure our application. Having obtained feedback from users regarding the start page in the previous sprint, and created UI wireframe and obtain user feedback from a questionnaire regarding UI wireframe, we wanted to add multiplayer functionality and video chat. These features were essential for our product, since having identified [a gap in the market](#https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Portfolio/Background.md#a-gap-in-the-market) in the background section we knew that video chat with multiplayer mode were lacking in existing gaming platforms for older people.

### Key points

   * Implement multiplayer functionality for connect four.
   * Research and add video chat to the games.
   * Build database and add relevant documentation
   * Build API

### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * Obtained feedback from users regarding the start page.
   * Created UI wireframe and obtain user feedback.
   * Created and circulated questionnaire regarding UI wireframe.
   * Started building back-end.
   * Built basic versions of games and obtained user feedback.
   * Created a user login.
   * Continue with documentation with a focus on Sprints and project management.

Perhaps you could provide some written instructions on how to use your product, since it won't be abundantly clear how to use it without explicitly laying out the steps to take. You could even provide an instructional video which guides the user through the process of using the application. The main point here is that I think you may find that some of your end-users will need some assistance with logging in before they feel to do this by themselves.</td>

Given this, it was decided that we would build the memory game from scratch using typescript, and make use of the Angular application development.</td>

### Evaluation of Sprint


Following our two week break from Agile sprints, we felt better placed to tackle our fourth sprint. At this stage, we had covered a lot of ground with regards to the UI and UX design, and the start page and login were suitable for our end-users. We had also built two working games. But these games still lacked multiplayer functionality and didn't have a functioning video feed, so it was clear that a lot of work was still required to not only get these two games up and running, but also to integrate the games with the start page and login.

There were still many new features to add to our product and we had four new fairly challenging backlog items to complete, including building the database and API, adding multiplayer functionality and video chat and continuing with documentation. On reflection, these tasks may have been too large to complete over the course of one week - two weeks would have been more appropriate.


## Sprint 5 : Adding new features (12.04.21-19.04.21)
___


The aim of this sprint was to add new features to our product including a leaderboard. We also had to complete the backlog items from the previous week.

### Key points

   * Build a leaderboard

### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * Implement multiplayer functionality for connect four
   * Database built



### Backlog items

```
  → Backlog item: implement multiplayer functionality for memory game
  → Backlog item: add video chat to connect four
  → Backlog item: add relevant documentation for database
  → Backlog item: build API

### Evaluation of Sprint


We felt we were able to do a lot of work during this sprint. Having a start-page to show the users and collect feedback was invaluable at this stage of the development. However, we weren't able to produce a MVP, which on reflection we would have liked to have done by this stage of the development lifecycle. Regardless, we were happy with a progress by this point in time. The designs for the backend were coming along nicely and it seemed that we would be able to integrate the front and back-end fairly easily.

It was clear, however, that our workload in the other units of term was getting bigger, and as such our progress might slow down over the coming weeks. We also wanted to better understand how we would build the database and API. This would take time and was likely to be a backlog item which carried through to subsequent sprints.

## Sprint 6 : Front-end and back-end integration (19.04.21-26.04.21)

___

The aim of this sprint was to decide on our architecture and how we intended to progress. Practically speaking, we got setup on Github, and set about understanding the basics of GitHub with push and pull requests. We agreed upon how we would communicate with one another. We decided on multiplayer board games for the elderly with a video feed. We also decided to call the product 'NotSoBored Games'. And, in addition, we began by adding to the readme in our repository.

to add video chat and multiplayer functionality to the memory game

### Key points

   * We made the group decision to use the MEAN stack.
   * Complete documentation on system implementation
   * Set up GitHub repository and familiarised ourselves with the platform.

### Key implementations from previous sprint

   * GitHub protocol established
   * User stories created
   * Lizhao presented the paper prototype video she has been creating.
   * Chris updated on progress of the Java produced Connect 4 game.
   * Browsed previously completed group projects together.

## Sprint 8 : Finish report and complete unit testing (03.05.21-07.05.21)
___

The aim of this sprint was to finish the write up for our project report. Although our report, by this stage, was fairly thorough and well-documented, we still had a lot to write up, particularly on the system implementation, evaluation of design and conclusion. We agreed to allocate subsections to different team members so that the workload was distributed evenly. We also had to complete unit testing our code, which was something we were yet to complete.

### Key points

   * Every team member was tasked to complete subsections of the report.
   * Finish unit testing
   * Complete introduction video

### Key implementations from previous sprint

   *

### Backlog items

```
  → Backlog item: complete report documentation
  → Backlog item: conduct unit testing
  → Backlog item: complete introduction video


```
### Evaluation of Sprint

This was our final sprint. The main thrust of the work to complete was documentation. This was relatively straightforward since we had been very consistent with documenting our report from very early on in the development lifecycle. The other backlog items were completing unit testing and finalising our introduction video. Whilst these tasks weren't particularly challenging, they did take up quite a bit of time, and on reflection, we would have been better off doing unit testing earlier on in the project since it was an important task which took time.


## Team use of Git

One of the most important tools we used during this project was GitHub. Github is an open-source code hosting service for building software and sharing code - a version control system for managing source code. It proved indispensable throughout the development since it stored a complete history of our project. It was important, however, that we used the platform in a structured and rational way. With this in mind, we decided to draw up guidelines on how to the team would use it. This was essential because it meant that we were able to push progress onto the repository where everyone from the team could access it and commit further changes.

After setting up GitHub, we realised it was important to utilise the branch-based workflow of the platform. As such, we created a number of different branches, 12 in total. Each branch was given a unique name and contained a unique set of code and documentation changes. This was to make sure that every team member had a specific feature to work on, and diverge from the main line of development.

<div align="center">

![alt text](https://github.com/ChrisEssery/group-project/blob/dev/Logo/branches.png)

</div>

The dev branch ('dev' for develop) was the main branch for new pull requests and code commits, and as such it was where the majority of our code and documentation was stored. We would push code to the dev branch from branches we were working on, and periodically merge the dev branch with the main branch once we had reached major milestones such as creating the start-page, games, and completing documentation. The main branch (formerly known as the 'master' branch) was where our finalised code and documentation would sit.

With regards to the other branches, our GitHub protocol was as follows:

 1. Create a new branch for every new feature and pull from dev branch regularly.
 2. Once that feature is complete, then create a pull request, and someone from the team either approves or asks for request changes.
 3. Next, merge the branch with the dev branch.
 4. If merge successful, delete branch.

By following this protocol, we had a formalised set of rules to follow when using GitHub.
